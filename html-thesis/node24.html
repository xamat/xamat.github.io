<P>
In a general sense we can define a framework as a general pool of
constructs for understanding a domain that is not tightly enough organized
to constitute a predictive theory. However, it is possible to add
additional details so as to come up with a predictive theory from
a framework. One judges a framework in terms of the success or fruitfulness
of the theories it generates [<A
 HREF="node207.html#AndersonCognition">Anderson, 1983</A>].

<P>
The term framework is very much used in software engineering, especially
in relation to object-oriented analysis and design. The first object-oriented
frameworks to be considered as such are the MVC (Model View Controller)
for Smalltalk and the MacApp for Apple applications. Other important
frameworks from this initial phase were ET++[<A
 HREF="node207.html#WeinandET++89">Weinand et&nbsp;al., 1989</A>]
and Interviews. It is interesting to note that most of the seminal
frameworks were related to designing user interfaces. In the framework
history, it is also important to cite the name of the Taligent company,
a joint venture of Apple Computer, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. They developed
a set of tools for rapid application development under the name of
``Common Point'' that consist on more than a hundred OO frameworks.

<P>
The most accepted definition for an object oriented framework is:
``a framework is a set of classes that embodies an abstract design
for solutions to a family of problems'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#JohnsonReusableClasses">Johnson and Foote, 1988</A>].
In the framework literature [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BeckPatternsGenerate">Beck and Johnson, 1994</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#TaligentBuildingOOFrameworks">Taligent, 1994</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#BoschFrameworksProblemsExperiences">Bosch et&nbsp;al., 1999</A>]
we can find similar definitions that can be summarized in the following:
A framework is the reusable design of a system or a part of a system
expressed as a set of abstract classes and the way the instances of
those classes collaborate; a framework is a set of prefabricated software
building blocks that programmers can use, extend, or customize for
specific computing solutions; frameworks are large abstract applications
in a particular domain that can be tailored for individual applications;
a framework is a reusable software architecture comprising both design
and code. As [<A
 HREF="node207.html#JohnsonComponents">Johnson, 1997</A>] points out, although different,
all definitions are correct because they focus on different views
of a framework such as structural or functional.
