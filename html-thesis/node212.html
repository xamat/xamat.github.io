Release 0.5</A>
</H2>

<P>
Release 0.5 represented a step forward into the framework being more
stable, robust, and usable. A new cross-platform build system was
devised for making the process of creating a CLAM makefile or Visual
project easy and transparent to the user, this tool is generically
called Srcdeps. Formal and thorough testing was introduced through
the use of he external CppUnit testing framework. 

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">network mode</SPAN> is implemented in about 90%, with a fully
working Visual Builder (see definition of Visual Builder in section
<A HREF="node26.html#sec:FrameworkClassification">1.3.3</A>), called Network Editor, that allows
to construct CLAM networks (see <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>). It
is becoming clearer every time that it makes no sense to make the
distinction between the two modes. The usage of Ports and Networks
(see <A HREF="node118.html#sec:_Network_Infrastructure">3.2.2</A>) will become first the recommended,
then the standard and finally the only way of building a CLAM system.
The only difference that still exists and is meant to stay that way
between the Visual Builder approach and the more traditional black/white-box
approach is that in the former an automatic flow control and scheduling
engine is deployed.

<P>
Long-sought full 100% support to Mac OSX has been introduced in this
release, including support for platform abstraction such as audio
input/output.

<P>
Other important issues include a major rework of the Visualization
module and XML facilities and many new features introduced into the
AnalysisSynthesisExample, which from this release on will be called
SMS Example (or SMSTools in its GUI version). The implementation of
Descriptors was addressed during this release although will not be
finished until future releases. Finally many new simple usage examples
were introduced and code cleanup was addressed throughout.
