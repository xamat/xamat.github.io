The Shannon&amp;Weaver Model</A>
</H3>

<P>
The most commonly accepted and spread communication model is that
proposed by electrical engineer Claude Shannon in 1949 and then interpreted
by Warren Weaver. It must be noted that particularly Shannon's model
was intended to be an information transmission model, mostly applicable
for engineering purposes. Nevertheless, Weaver's interpretation, as
well as further later uses converted it in a general usage communication
model. 

<P>
Shannon and Weaver introduced the linear model represented in figure
<A HREF="#fig:Shannon-_SPMamp_-Weaver_s">5.16</A>. The goal of any communication system
is to transmit a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">data source</SPAN> to a particular <SPAN  CLASS="textit">destination</SPAN>.
The transmission is carried out through a physical <SPAN  CLASS="textit">channel</SPAN>
that is bound to influence the message, a non-ideal transmission channel
can indeed be considered a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">noise source</SPAN>. The engine in charge
of preparing the data source and sending it through the channel is
called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transmitter</SPAN>. This transmitter is in charge of different
process but the most important is that of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encoding</SPAN> the message
so it can be transmitted more efficiently and it can become more robust
to the effect of the channel. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">receiver</SPAN> is in charge of
obtaining the message from the channel, decoding it, removing noise
as much as possible and deliver it to the final destination.

<P>
In this metamodel, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">information</SPAN> is thought of as the opposite
to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">entropy</SPAN>. Meaning is unimportant from that mathematical point
of view. According to Shannon and Weaver ``the semantic aspects
of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ShannonWeaver">Shannon and Weaver, 1949</A>].
As Eric Scheirer points out this is not an engineering assumption
but rather a philosophical one [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerSAKolmogorov">Scheirer, 2001</A>].

<P>
In a similar way, in S&amp;W's model <SPAN  CLASS="textit">noise</SPAN> is anything added by
the channel and not intended by the source. The way to overcome the
unwanted effects of noise is by adding redundancy. As a matter of
fact the S&amp;W theory considers that communication is the science of
maintaining and optimal balance between predictability and uncertainty
by adding or removing redundancy.
