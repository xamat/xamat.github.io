Notes

<P>
When an Instrument Generator receives an event or message it responds
to them by either changing its internal state or by ``activating''
special objects that also contribute to the Generator state. These
objects are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Notes</SPAN>. A musical Note is defined as a sound
object that has a precise and explicit active lifespan (i.e. the note
duration), a certain loudness, an optional pitch and other optional
attributes. The pitch, just as the other attributes in a Note, is
not constant and can vary in run-time as the Note object responds
to an incoming message. Therefore, an incoming message will produce
a change in the Note internal state by modifying any of its attributes.
A special message, because of its consequences is the ``Stop''
message. This will cause the Note object to transition to an inactive
state but will generally, and as it will be seen in next paragraphs,
not imply the object destruction.

A Note object is associated to its owner Generator and will only respond
to messages sent through it. A Generator is by nature monophonic,
this meaning that it can only hold a single sounding note at a certain
moment. For this reason when a Generator is created it is granted
an associated inactive Note. This Note will become active whenever
the Generator receives a ``play note'' message from its Instrument. 

<P>
It is important to understand, though, that the fact that a Generator
has a single Note object through all its lifespan is just for convenience
and could conceptually be understood of a set of Notes that are instantiated
and de-instantiated every time they start/stop sounding. In this sense
the concept of Note that we are here using is perfectly compatible
with the Note obtained in the analysis phase of an OOCTM metamodel
(see section <A HREF="node160.html#sub:The-Semantic-Transmitter">5.2.1</A>.

<P>
Ranges of valid attributes for a particular Note, such as its minimum
and maximum pitch, are handled by its Generator. Clearly the Note
object is completely transparent to the rest of the musical system
that will only treat with messages sent to Instruments and particular
Generators present in it.

Our model of Note is very different from that of event-oriented music
models such as Music-N where a Note is considered an event. As a matter
of fact our music model also includes the idea of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Note event</SPAN>
that will be explained in next section. But it is important to note
that this consideration of a Note as something completely different
from an event is not exclusively ours. As Miller Puckette explains
in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PucketteFTS">Puckette, 1991b</A>] already in RTSKED (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MathewsRTSKED">Mathews and Pasquale, 1981</A>])
a note was considered as a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">process</SPAN> and this same idea was pushed
forward in FTS and Max. The combination of our Generator/Note structure
is also very similar to the note in ZIPI (see section <A HREF="node88.html#sub:ZIPI">2.6.2</A>).
