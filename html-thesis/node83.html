<P>
CSound [<A
 HREF="node207.html#VercoeCSound">Vercoe, 1992</A>] is a Music-N language that was first designed
to make this technology portable and available in any platform with
the only requirement of having a C language compiler. CSound has suffered
several revisions during the years and now includes contributions
from many different collaborators, most of them computer music composers.
But, above all, CSound is the project of Barry Vercoe [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-BarryVercoe">www-BarryVercoe, </A>].

<P>
CSound has gained a great acceptance in the academic community but
has not become a mainstream tool, possibly because of the relative
complexity of the language and the requirement of some previous programming
experience.

<P>
In CSound an orchestra definition file is a regular text file written
according to a specified protocol. This orchestra file is made up
of a header and a list of instruments. In the header we can find global
parameters such as the output sampling rate (sr) or the control frequency
(kr).

<P>
The instrument definition starts with an instrument label and finishes
with an end declaration. In between those two statements, different
declarations are included. These declarations define the modules or
functions that will be used and the way that they will interact.

<P>
The CSound score file is also a standard text file that follows a
particular syntax and protocol. As a matter of fact it is just an
ordered list of labels and numbers separated by a whitespace.

<P>
The score file can begin by defining a set of function tables that
will be used to generate the synthesis waveforms. From the score body
itself there is the possibility of sending messages to these functions
or to an instrument in the orchestra. If the message is to be sent
to a function it will start with ``f(x)'' and if it is intended
to affect an instrument with ``i(x)'', where in both cases ``(x)''
is the number of the function or the instrument in the orchestra where
the message is addressed. The next elements in a message are the temporal
definition of the event start and its duration. The following values
are addressed to the different parameters and their meaning is determined
by the particular instrument definition.

<P>
In the following example we can see the two different kind of instruments
available in a score. The first one is addressed to a table that generates
sinusoidal waveforms and the second one is addressed to an orchestra
instrument, asking it to produce a 5 seconds note starting at time
0.
