SAOL and SASL
</H3>

<P>
SAOL and SASL are languages included in MPEG-4's Structured Audio
component. In section <A HREF="node155.html#ch:_OOCTM">5</A> we will comment on the whole
conceptual model behind Structured Audio. But we will now concentrate
on its Music-N facet represented by the SAOL language for defining
orchestras and the SASL language for musical scores.

<P>
The Structured Audio Orchestra Language (SAOL) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerSAOL_CMJ">Scheirer, 1999b</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerSAOLICMC">Scheirer, 1998a</A>]
is a general purpose synthesis language derived from CSound. Compared
to CSound, SAOL presents improved syntax, a smaller set of core functions,
and a number of additional syntactic features. SAOL is optimized for
digital audio synthesis and digital audio effects but any digital
signal processing that can be expressed as a signal flow can be expressed
in SAOL [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerMP4SA_ICASSP">Scheirer, 1998b</A>].

<P>
SAOL is a two rate synthesis language: every variable represents either
an audio signal that varies with the sampling rate or a control signal
that varies at the control rate. The sampling rate limits the audio
frequencies and the control rate limits the speed with which the parameters
can vary.

<P>
Stored function tables are called wavetables. SAOL has about 100 primitive
processing instructions, signal generators, and operators. A typical
decoding process may also include a step that resembles linking a
high-level language with a fixed library of abstract functions. These
primitives hold most complexity for SAOL and can be optimized for
specific implementations.

<P>
In practice, two different implementations of SAOL decoders exist
at the moment of this writing. The reference software included in
the standard uses the interpreter approach resulting in a very inefficient
application. The other implementation is called sfront [<A
 HREF="node207.html#LazzaroSfront">Lazzaro and Wawrzynek, 2001</A>]
and consists on a program that translates SAOL into a C program that
is then compiled and executed.

<P>
SAOL defines a two-level syntax: at the bit level to describe the
messages that will be streamed into a network and at a higher level
to provide an understandable representation of the language. We will
briefly mention this latter, which is more directly related to our
interests.

<P>
The language is a BNF (Backus-Naur Form) grammar. It contains punctuation
signs that are used to give messages a particular syntax; identifiers
that define orchestra symbols; numbers that describe constant values;
comments that add internal documentation; and whitespaces that lexically
separate the different text elements.

<P>
The orchestra is the set of signal processing routines and declarations
that conform a procedure description in Structured Audio. It is made
up of four different elements:

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Global Block</SPAN> contains the definition of those parameters
that are global to the orchestra. It must be unique for an orchestra
and it can hold five different kinds of messages: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">global parameters</SPAN>
such as sampling rate, control rate, or number of audio inputs and
outputs; definition of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">global variables</SPAN> that can be used from
different instruments; <SPAN  CLASS="textit">path</SPAN> definitions describing how the
instrument outputs will be addressed to the buses; and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sequence</SPAN>
definitions in order to control instruments on real-time.

<P>
After the Global Block we find the instrument definitions where the
necessary sequences in order to process SASL or MIDI instructions
are defined. An instrument declaration is made up of the following
parts (in the given order): an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">identifier</SPAN> that defines the
instrument name; a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">list of identifiers</SPAN> that define the names
of the parameters involved in that particular instrument (pfield);
an optional value to specify the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">MIDI preset</SPAN>; an optional value
specifying the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">MIDI channel</SPAN>; a list of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">variable declarations</SPAN>;
and a set of messages that define the instrument functionality.

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Opcode</SPAN> is simply a function that can have several inputs
or variables and a single output or result. Opcodes can be used from
any instrument in the orchestra. SAOL offers a set of ready-to-use
Opcodes called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Core Opcodes</SPAN> that include things such as mathematical
functions or noise generators. The user can use the implemented opcodes
or define new ones.

<P>
A function declaration has different elements in the following order:
a number that defines the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">velocity</SPAN> with which it is executed;
an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">identifier</SPAN> that defines the name of the function; a list
of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">formal parameters</SPAN> in the function; a list of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">variable
declarations</SPAN>; and a set of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">messages</SPAN> that define the functionality.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Template Instruments</SPAN> describe multiple instruments that are
made slightly different using a limited syntax of parameters.

<P>
Elements in the orchestra can appear in any order. For instance, a
function definition can appear before or after being used.

<P>
The other language in Structured Audio is the Structured Audio Score
Language (SASL), an event description language that will be used to
generate sounds in the orchestra. SASL syntax has been kept very simple
and includes very few high-level control structures, this is left
for the implementer of the specific tool (sequencer, editor...).

<P>
Just as SAOL, SASL describes a two-level control language although
we will just mention the user level, based on a list of text messages.

<P>
Any event in a SASL score has a temporal statement that defines at
what moment it takes place. This time statement can only be specified
in musical notation and therefore the absolute time depends on the
value of the tempo global variable.

<P>
A SASL score has different kinds of lines: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument Lines</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Control Lines</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Tempo Lines</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Table Lines</SPAN>, and
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">End Lines</SPAN>. 

<P>
An Instrument Line (InstrLine) specifies an instrument initialization
at a particular moment. It has the following elements: the first identifier
is the label that will be used to refer to the instrument; the first
number is the initial time of the instrument; the second identifier
is the instrument name that is used to select one of the instruments
described in the SAOL file; the second number is the temporal duration
of the instrument initialization (if it is -1, the initialization
has no temporal limit); and finally it has a list of parameters (pfields)
that will be passed to the instrument for its creation.

<P>
A Control Line specifies an instruction that is sent to the orchestra
or a set of instruments. It is made of the following elements: the
first number specifies the initial time of the event; the first identifier
(optional) specifies what instruments will receive the event; the
second identifier is the name of the variable that will receive the
event; finally the second number is the new value for the control
variable.

<P>
A Tempo Line specifies the new value for this global variable for
the decoding process. It has two elements: the first number is the
time when the tempo change will be applied; and the second number
is the new tempo value specified in ppm.

<P>
A Table Line specifies the creation or destruction of a wavetable.
It contains the following elements: the first identifier is the name
of the table; the second identifier is the name of the table generator
or the ``destroy'' instruction; the list of pfields id the list
of parameter for the wavetable; and the sample refers to the sound
from which the wavetable is extracted.

<P>
And finally a Final Line specifies the end of the sound generating
process.

<P>
Structured Audio also offers a simpler format for music synthesis.
A format for representing banks of wavetables, the Structured Audio
Sample Bank Format (SASBF) was created in collaboration with the MIDI
Manufacturer's Association. Wavetables can be downloaded into the
synthesizer and controlled with MIDI sequences.
