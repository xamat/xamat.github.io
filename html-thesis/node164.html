The Coding Step (Content Description)</A>
</H3>

<P>
In the coding step, all the content information extracted and organized
in the form of objects in previous analysis step needs to be encoded
in an appropriate format. Ideally binary and textual based versions
of the format should be provided in order to provide both coding and
transmission efficiency and readability. It is also important for
the coding scheme used to offer support to the way that the output
of our analysis block is organized. In that sense, it is necessary
to use a highly structured language that enables the description of
a tree-like data structure giving also support to object-oriented
concepts.

<P>
Maybe the first idea that comes to mind is using UML as a way of describing
our content. UML is indeed a highly structured language and supports
all OO concepts. It would be an excellent choice for describing our
Sound Classes. But it is not so appropriate if what we want is to
describe the state of our objects/instances or, in other words, make
our objects persistent. On the other hand, and as described in section
<A HREF="node33.html#sub:MOF">1.4.3</A>, a quite immediate relation can be established between
in-memory objects declared in any object-oriented language and their
persistent representation or metadata. 

<P>
There are many examples of coding schemes used for encoding metadata
or, more precisely, audiovisual content description, perhaps the most
ambitious being MPEG7 (see <A HREF="node32.html#sub:MPEG-7">1.4.2</A>). Although MPEG7 is focused
on search and retrieval issues, the actual encoding of the audiovisual
content description is flexible enough as for being used in applications
as the ones envisioned in this thesis [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7BeyondDatabase">Ebrahimi and Christopoulos, 1998</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#LindsayMultipleRepresentationsInMPEG7">Lindsay and Kriechbaum, 1999</A>]. 

<P>
Our Content Transmission metamodel does not enforce a particular description
scheme such as MPEG-7 but does recommend XML as an appropriate encoding
format. Besides, our Sound Objects are in fact DSPOOM Processing Data's
and their attached features are DSPOOM Descriptors. If CLAM is used
as an appropriate implementation of the metamodel all such object
have automatic built-in XML persistence (see section <A HREF="node119.html#sec:_CLAMTools">3.2.2</A>).
Note that, as a matter of fact, XML-Schema will be the language used
for structuring our content or defining Sound Classes, but the actual
output of the analysis or content of the identified objects will be
a standard XML document. 

<P>
On the other hand, the encoding step must also be in charge of deciding
the degree of abstraction to be applied to the output of the content
extraction step. This decision must be taken on the basis of the application
and the user's requirements although it will obviously affect the
data transmission rate. The encoder must decide what level of the
content tree should indeed be encoded depending on the degree of concreteness
demanded to the transmission process, degree that will usually be
fixed by the particularities of the receiver. If only high-level semantic
information is encoded, the receiver will be forced to use more of
its 'artificial imagination' (see next section). The more low-leveled
the information encoded is, the more 'real world knowledge' the receiver
should have.

<P>
Another subject, which will not be dealt with, is how this textual
information could be compressed and transformed into a more efficient
binary format suitable for transmission. Suffice it to say that different
solutions, such as MPEG7's Binary Format[<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7Book">Manjunath et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>], have been
found to this issue.
