OpenMusic [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpenMusicAgon02c">Agon and Assayag, 2002</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpenMusicAssayag00a">Assayag and Agon, 2000</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpenMusicDechelle03a">D&#233;chelle, 2003</A>]
is an object-oriented visual environment for musical composition based
on Common Lisp. It represents a completely different approach from
other applications in this category as it is restricted only to the
symbolic manipulation of musical material and problems such as performance
and real-time processing are outside of its scope. OpenMusic deals
with models and proposes a composition based on structures and relations.
OpenMusic is available for most operating systems [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpenMusicSarria03a">Sarria and Diago, 2003</A>].

<P>
OpenMusic is a continuation of Patchwork. This environment was used
and valued by many composers but several limitations evidenced that
it needed a major rework. First, Patchwork was the result of numerous
incremental improvements and it was difficult to maintain. Also, Patchwork
was centered around the patch editor window where functional modules
could be connected to perform any calculation. These functions were
made available as standard kernel boxes, as standard Common Lisp functions,
as parts of user-libraries, or could be directly programmed by the
user in Common Lisp. But the main problem was that it was extremely
difficult to collect information from one patch to use in another.

<P>
OpenMusic aims at improving the patches relationships, to dynamically
create object definitions, to facilitate communication between different
forms of the same musical structure and to place all this into an
easy editable temporal context. The other problem of relations between
patches is solved with the Maquette Editor (see below).

<P>
A program (patch) is a graphical layout on the screen. This layout
is made of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">simple frames</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">composed frames,</SPAN> which contain
simple frames or are empty. All the computing objects in OpenMusic
are represented as simple or composed frames and several different
frames can be produced for the same object. A simple frame representing
an object is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object view</SPAN> and generally appear as icons.
Composed frames representing an object are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object containers</SPAN>
and generally provide a graphical editor for the object. The container
for a class is an ordered collection of simple frames representing
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">slots</SPAN>. Slots have information about their name, type, a default
value, and a flag that indicates if the slot is public or private.

<P>
Users can create instances of a class with the aid of a particular
box called a factory. They can also create new methods or modify existing
ones. In the same way users can create and redefine their own classes.

<P>
Instead of a simple graphical interface to CLOS, OpenMusic is regarded
as an extension of CLOS with metaprogramming techniques. A protocol
of generic functions applicable to all OM objects has been defined,
some of them to relate classes and their graphical representation.
By using metaprogramming the user can also make extensions to the
OpenMusic language. The following tools are available: subclassing
inside the static class definition and redefining functions in the
dynamic protocol.

<P>
Open Music contains a simple musical class hierarchy. <TT>Note</TT>,
<TT>Rest</TT>, <TT>Sound</TT> and <TT>Midifile</TT> derive from <TT>Simple-score-element</TT>.
<TT>Voice</TT>, <TT>Measure</TT> and <TT>Group</TT> derive from <TT>Sequence</TT>.
And <TT>Chord</TT> and <TT>Poly</TT> derive from <TT>Superposition</TT>.

<P>
A set of musical operators are also defined. They work on musical
structures such as voices. For instance the operator <TT>fusion</TT>
merges two different voices and the result is a voice that contains
simultaneously the notes in both initial structures. The <TT>masking</TT>
operator also operates on two voices and performs a masking effect
on one of them (data voice) using the other (masking voice) as the
mask.

<P>
The Maquette is an interface that allows the creation of blocks placed
in spatial and/or temporal relationships. These blocks are linked
to patches. The Maquette is an original concept in OM used for combining
the design of high-level musical structures, arrange musical material
in time, and specify musical algorithms. A Maquette editor is an editor
with 2D surface with time on the x-axis on which temporal boxes are
laid. Temporal boxes can reference a temporal object (object with
start time and duration such as chord or voice), patches (which are
not temporal objects but can deliver one as result), and another Maquette
(a Maquette can be embedded in another Maquette). The user can choose
to see the Maquette as a score (in traditional or graphical notation)
or a set of interconnected processes.

<P>
It is also interesting to note that OpenMusic has been used as a control
language for sound synthesis [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpenMusicAgon00a">Agon et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>]. In this case
the basic idea was not to implement synthesis engines but to handle
musical structures visually and then generate low-level parameters
to send to whatever engine is available.
