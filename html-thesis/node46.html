Data flow architecture</A>
</H3>

<P>
A variety of applications apply a series of transformations to a data
stream. The architectures emphasize data flow and control flow is
not represented explicitly. They consist of a set of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">modules</SPAN>
that interconnect forming a new module or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">network</SPAN>. The modules
are self-contained entities that perform generic operations that can
be used in a variety of contexts. A module is a computational unit
while a network is an operational unit. The application functionality
is determined by: types of modules and interconnections between modules.
The application could also be required to adapt dynamically to new
requirements.

<P>
In this context, sometimes a high-performance toolkit applicable to
a wide range of problems is required. The application may need to
adapt dynamically or at run-time. In complex applications it is not
possible to construct a set of components that cover all potential
combinations. The loose coupling associated with the black-box paradigm
usually has performance penalties: generic context-free efficient
algorithms are difficult to obtain. Software modules could have different
incompatible interfaces, share state, or need global variables.

<P>
The Solution is to highlight the data flow such that the application's
architecture can be seen as a network of modules. Inter-module communication
is done by passing messages (sometimes called tokens) through unidirectional
input and output ports (replacing direct calls). Depending on the
number and types of ports, modules can be classified into <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sources</SPAN>
(only have output ports and interface with an input device), <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sinks</SPAN>
(only have input ports and interface with output devices), and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">filters</SPAN>
(have both input and output ports). 

<P>
Because any of the component depends only on the upstream modules
it is possible to change output connections at run-time. For two modules
to be connected the output port of the upstream module and the input
port of the downstream module must be plug-compatible. Having more
than one data type means that some modules perform specialized processing.
Filters that do not have internal state could be replaced while the
system is running. The network usually triggers recomputations whenever
a filter output changes.

<P>
In a network, adjacent performance-critical modules could be regarded
as a larger filter and replaced with an optimized version, using the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Adaptive Pipeline</SPAN> pattern [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PosnakAdaptivePipeline">Posnak et&nbsp;al., 1996</A>] which
trades flexibility for performance. Modules that use static composition
cannot be dynamically configured.
