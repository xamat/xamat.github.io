Dynamic and Static Views of Data Flow</A>
</H3>

<P>
Processing objects synchronously receive incoming data through their
input ports and output the processed data through their output ports.
Though it is many times convenient to keep this metaphor of travelling
data that enters the processing, is transformed and is fed to the
output, it is also important to sometimes think in terms of its ``static''
representation. Therefore two different interpretations may be given
to the flow of processing data through a DSPOOM network: a dynamic
view and a static view. Both of them are valid and their use will
depend on the goal of the particular model. 

<P>
In the dynamic view we think of a processing data as a travelling
entity that enters every processing in its path and exits sometimes
even in a different form. This interpretation is useful for analyzing
dynamic behavior of a given system specially regarding its latency
or real-time performance. It is also useful for understanding overall
effect of a processing network on the input signal.

<P>
When using the static dataflow view we interpret that processing data
all ``live'' in nodes or slots where different processing objects
are connected. A processing always reads from the same position in
memory and writes to the same position in memory so its input and
output ports can be seen as a static (in space) processing data that
is constantly changing. This view is interesting in order to study
flow related issues and the interaction that occur between neighboring
processing objects. We will later see more details about the network
structure, including the definition of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">data nodes</SPAN> (see section
<A HREF="node150.html#sub:Data-Nodes">4.1.3</A>), and understand more about this static view.
