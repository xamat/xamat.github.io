Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we have seen the various building blocks upon which
the thesis is built. We will now put them all into context, relating
them and pointing out the consequences of our domain analysis. We
will first briefly summarize the most important ideas introduced in
the different sections.

<P>
In section <A HREF="node7.html#sec:The-Object-Oriented-Paradigm">1.1</A> we have introduced
the most important concepts related to the object-oriented paradigm.
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object</SPAN> is a real-world or abstract entity made up of an
identity, a state, and a behavior. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">class</SPAN> is an abstraction
of a set of objects that have the same behavior and represent the
same kind of instances. The object-oriented paradigm can be deployed
in the different phases of a software life-cycle and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">UML</SPAN>
language supports most of the activities contained in them. Apart
from the concepts of object and class and the different kinds of relationships
that can be established between objects and classes, other concepts
such as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encapsulation</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inheritance hierarchies</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">polymorphism</SPAN>
are important for fully understanding the object-oriented paradigm.
The object-oriented paradigm presents many different advantages that
can be summarized in the following: it maps more directly to real
world concepts, it enhances <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encapsulation</SPAN>, it improves <SPAN  CLASS="textit">information
hiding</SPAN>, it promotes good structuring and it favors re-use. Finally,
it is important to note that, although it is often considered otherwise,
object-orientation does not imply less efficient code and furthermore
its techniques make it even easier to end up having more efficient
and robust final results.

<P>
In the next section, <A HREF="node16.html#sec:_Models_and_Systems">1.2</A>, we have defined
the main concepts related to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">models</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">systems</SPAN>. The
most commonly accepted definition of a system is that by Hall and
Fagen in which they define a system as ``a set of objects together
with relationships between the objects and between their attributes.''
On the other hand, a model is an abstract representation of a system
with a well-defined purpose, different models may exist for a single
system. It is also important to note that the birth of object-orientation
is very much related to the study of system simulations by Kristan
Nygaard. Finally we define a metamodel as a ``model of models'',
that is an abstract model that can be used to model a collection of
related models.

<P>
In section <A HREF="node23.html#sec:Frameworks">1.3</A> we have addressed the issue of software
framework development. Although many different definitions can be
given for a software framework it is that of Ralph E. Johnson in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#JohnsonReusableClasses">Johnson and Foote, 1988</A>]
the one that is usually cited. According to this definition,``a
framework is a set of classes that embodies an abstract design for
solutions to a family of problems''. Frameworks offer a way to reuse
analysis, design and code. Frameworks can be classified, among other
ways, into <SPAN  CLASS="textit">white-box</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">black-box</SPAN>. In white-box frameworks
users extend previously existing classes, particularizing for their
specific needs. On the other hand, black-box frameworks offer ready-to-use
components that can be used as building blocks for an application.
Although different approaches may be used for developing a software
framework, it is usually recommended to use an application-driven
methodology, using a limited amount of already existing applications
as the driving force and favoring user-feedback as much as possible.
Finally, a well-designed software framework can become a sort of metamodel
in itself as it will offer a model of models for a given domain.

<P>
Metadata is defined as ``data about data''. In section <A HREF="node30.html#sec:Metadata-and-Meta">1.4</A>
we introduce the most important concepts and tools related to metadata
and our domain of object-orientation and multimedia signal analysis.
XML is a general-purpose tagged language that is rapidly becoming
the standard for metadata annotation of any sort. Using this same
language, MPEG-7 is an ISO proposed standard for multimedia annotation.
On the other hand the Object Management Group of the ACM has also
proposed the MOF (Meta Object Facility) standard as a metadata management
framework for object-oriented systems and technologies.

<P>
Graphical Models of Computation are abstract representations of a
family of related computer-based systems that use a graph-based representation
as the primary way of communicating information about the system.
There are many different graphical MoC's, each of them particularly
well-suited for some purpose. The most important are outlined in section
<A HREF="node34.html#sec:GraphicalMoCs">1.5</A>. In the context of signal processing applications,
Kahn Process Networks and related models such as Dataflow Networks
are of particular importance. Although some authors defend that these
models should be seen as instances of the Process-Oriented paradigm
we defend the thesis that process-orientation or actor-orientation
is not more than a particular instance of the object-oriented paradigm.

<P>
As a conclusion we must point out that this present chapter has presented
the most important foundational issues upon which we build our thesis.
We have related concepts and ideas coming from disciplines such as
software engineering, signal processing and system analysis. Although
some of the issues here presented may seem trivial to a reader familiar
with a particular technology we believe that the way that subjects
are presented and related is not trivial in any way. Furthermore,
it is important that the reader of the next chapter has a clear view
of how and why different basic concepts are used.

<P>
It is in this sense important to note that although object-orientation
is the obvious driving force that ties together the different hypothesis
and parts of the work there other concepts presented in this chapter
are not less important. We use object-orientation for describing systems
through particular models and therefore it is important to have a
clear view of what both systems and models mean and how they are used.
It is also in this sense that graphical Models of Computation and
software patterns associated to them play an important role in our
work. 

<P>
Software frameworks also play a central part in this work. The whole
metamodel for digital signal processing, central to this Thesis and
presented in chapter <A HREF="node135.html#ch:_DSPOOM">4</A>, was abstracted from (or rather
in) the design of the CLAM framework for audio and music. It is also
a thesis of this work that software frameworks, when well-designed
and sufficiently generically constructed, generate domain metamodels,
where a metamodel can be defined as a model of models or a classification
of classes. Finally metadata is an important concept also related
to metamodels. In different parts of this thesis, and particularly
in chapter <A HREF="node155.html#ch:_OOCTM">5</A>, we will see ways of using metadata.
