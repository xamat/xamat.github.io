Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we have presented an object-oriented metamodel for
content processing and transmission (OOCTM). This metamodel may be
seen both as an extension and a particularization of the Digital Signal
Processing Object-Oriented Metamodel presented in chapter <A HREF="node135.html#ch:_DSPOOM">4</A>
and presents a way of modeling signal processing applications that
deal with all aspects of content-based processing such as content
analysis or content-based transformations.

<P>
The metamodel is based on two conceptual foundations: on one hand
we call <SPAN  CLASS="textit">content</SPAN> to any semantic information that is meaningful
for the target user; on the other hand, and applying one of the object-oriented
paradigm maximas, we state that all semantic information contained
in a given signal can be modelled as a collection of related objects.

<P>
Following the traditional Shannon&amp;Weaver model for information transmission
our metamodel is divided into three main components: a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">semantic
transmitter</SPAN>, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">channel</SPAN>, and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">semantic receiver</SPAN>. The
semantic transmitter is in charge of performing a multilevel analysis
on the signal, identifying objects and finally building a multilevel
object-based content description and encoding it in an appropriate
format such as XML. The channel transports this metadata description
and any added noise will not be considered as such unless the original
meaning is modified. Finally the semantic receiver receives the multilevel
content description, decodes it and translates it into a synthesizer-readable
format. The synthesizer included in the receiver then synthesizes
the output signal.

<P>
It is important to note that we are not so much interested in the
fidelity of the final synthesized signal to the original but rather
on whether the original ``meaning'' is preserved and is useful
for the final user.

<P>
The Object-Oriented Content Transmission Metamodel can be seen as
an extension of the classical Shannon&amp;Weaver model for information
transmission. The metamodel should be understood as a conceptual framework
that can be instantiated to build working applications. In this sense
it demonstrates how new technological advances have brought up the
opportunity of redefining a communication model that is more than
50 years old. The metamodel is very much related to the Structured
Audio metamodel and can also be seen as a step beyond parametric encoding.
Finally if we add a transformation function to the channel we end-up
having a general scheme for content-based transformations.

<P>
Anyway one may question the benefits of content-based audio applications.
It is our opinion that by concentrating on the transmission of content
description we are actually favoring the distinction between content
and its realization. And, by doing so we favor a higher level approach,
encapsulation, concept reuse, the upcoming of new applications (i.e.
content-based transformations), data reduction, and robustness enhancement,
to name a few. In this sense in the current chapter we have also given
several examples of applications that represent particular instances
of the metamodel or subparts and one in particular that instantiates
the whole metamodel in order to transmit and synthesize a previously
analyzed and extracted musical melody.

<P>
As a conclusion we may state that we have presented a new metamodel
for information transmission that does care about meaning and content.
The Object-Oriented Content Transmission uses a fully object-oriented
view and an interpretation of content as any meaningful information
for the user in order to present a conceptual framework that can give
rise to many new and interesting applications. We have shown in practice
some sample applications and, although still embrionary, they demonstrate
the practicality of the metamodel.
