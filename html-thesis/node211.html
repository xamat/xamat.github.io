CLAM becomes public</A>

<P>
The AGNULA IST project [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-Agnula">www-Agnula, </A>] started in April 2002 and
represented a major contribution for the growth of the CLAM framework.
This European ``accompanying measure'' aimed at providing two
distributions of GNU/Linux focused on Audio and Multimedia. One distribution
was to be based on Debian and called Demudi and the other based on
RedHat and named Rehmudi. Both versions would be entirely made from
Free Software (Free as defined by the Free Software Foundation [<A
 HREF="node207.html#FSF">Free Software Foundation, </A>]).
CLAM was the main contribution by the Music Technology Group at the
Pompeu Fabra University. 

<P>
The inclusion of CLAM in such a project brought big and immediate
changes into the general conception and philosophy of the framework.
The most important change was that a framework that was being designed
as an internal tool was to become public and accessible. This would
introduce major changes into the development process that would also
benefit internal users. Furthermore, CLAM was not only going to become
public but also Free and distributed under the GPL license. And finally,
although the initial targeted user was exclusively the researcher
that needed to test/implement research algorithms now we had to also
take into account the regular developer that chose our framework for
simply developing and audio or music applications or even the user
that was interested in working with one of the sample applications.

<P>
The first ``public'' release (Release 0.3) was published in April
2002. This release was published on the website [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-CLAM">www-CLAM, </A>] but
was not publicly announced. It was used to test all the different
mechanisms related to the public release and to beta-test the framework
itself. A mirror of the internal CVS repository was made, and public
access, with no commit rights, was granted. The release was tested
by internal users and by students with no experience that were exposed
to the framework and asked to develop a basic spectral analysis/synthesis
application.

<P>
CLAM was indeed first publicly presented at the 2002 Conference on
Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA
'02). CLAM was presented both as a poster and a demonstration [<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatOOPSLADemo">Amatriain et&nbsp;al., 2002c</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatOOPSLAPoster">Amatriain et&nbsp;al., 2002a</A>].
For this event different concepts were clarified and discussed but
most importantly the sample applications were brought to a more stable
stage. We demonstrated SMSTools, SALTO and SpectralDelay (see <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>
for details on these applications).

<P>
After this presentation the first formal beta release (release 0.4)
was publicly announced in the context of the AGNULA project. This
release included, in relation to the previous, many bugfixes, a much
better and larger documentation and a new directory structure for
the code. The examples demonstrated at the OOPSLA conference were
also integrated into the public release.

<P>
The following minor releases introduced many other issues as the testing
infrastructure using the cppunit framework. But most efforts were
put into the SMSTools application, which was then called AnalysisSynthesisExample,
in order to bring it to a usable stage. Because of this enhancements
were pushed forward in the Processing repository (i.e. including new
transformations based on the SMS algorithm) or the XML and Visualization
infrastructure. The build system was also enhanced during this release.
