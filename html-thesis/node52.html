Introduction. A Classification of Audio and Music Processing Environments</A>
</H1>

<P>
As already mentioned the great number of existing environments for
audio and music processing depart from different requirements and
many focus on different aspects of audio and music. Before describing
these different environments we will give a brief, and therefore incomplete,
classification.

<P>
Until now, we have intentionally been using the word ``environment''
instead of ``framework''. The reason is that we will only use
the word framework when talking about an application or domain framework
in the sense described in section <A HREF="node23.html#sec:Frameworks">1.3</A>. The environments
included in this present chapter range from full-fledged application
frameworks such as Open Sound World (see <A HREF="node64.html#sub:Open-Sound-World">2.3.2</A>)
or SndObj (see <A HREF="node68.html#sub:SndObj">2.3.3</A>) to simple visual applications with
some extension capabilities such as WaveWarp (<A HREF="node78.html#sub:WaveWarp">2.5</A>).
Some environments (see Supercollider in section <A HREF="node82.html#sub:SuperCollider">2.6.1</A>)
even go a step further and offer a complete programming language.
This difference offers us a first classifying criteria, with extremely
flexible application frameworks or programming languages on one end
and simple applications on the other. Optimizing flexibility often
compromises other features, namely usability or understandability,
so a compromise needs to be taken.

<P>
Another interesting question that is particularly important for music
and audio environments is whether a particular environment is focused
on analysis, synthesis or both. Audio and music analysis has quite
different requirements from synthesis and it is often difficult to
match both. (As a simple example, in audio synthesis real-time performance
is a big issue while in analysis application, the most important issue
is usually how to organize and effectively store the analysis results).

<P>
In figure <A HREF="#fig:Classification-of-environments">2.1</A> we illustrate
a temptative graphical classification map of the different environments
reviewed in this chapter. We distinguish environments that have already
been discontinued in dotted lines. On the other hand, the most important
environments are highlighted with a larger font size. Note that although
special care has been put on the position of each environment in some
particular cases the fact that one environment is above or below another
one, especially in overcrowded clusters,  is meaningless and responds
to purely aesthetic reasons.

<P>

Many other features can be used to classify these environments. After
presenting the CLAM framework in next chapter we will concentrate
on some of them in order to highlight its similarities and differences.
Nevertheless it is already interesting to list them in order to focus
our attention on those particularly interesting features. When looking
at one of this environments, apart from the three conceptual issues
previously commented we will also be interested in the following issues:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is it cross-platform?
</LI>
<LI>Is it Free Software?
</LI>
<LI>What are its limitations regarding the kind of signals that can be
processed?
</LI>
<LI>Is it efficient?
</LI>
<LI>Is it maintained, updated and documented?
</LI>
<LI>Does it include both an algorithm repository as well as general infrastructure?
</LI>
<LI>What programming language is it written in?
</LI>
<LI>Is the model presented object-oriented?
</LI>
</UL>
Bearing all this issues in mind we will now give an overview of existing
music and audio processing environments<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5544"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>. We have classified them into four main categories: general purpose
signal processing and multimedia environments, audio processing frameworks,
music processing frameworks, audio and music graphical programming
applications and music languages. It is important to note that although
we have forced every environment to be classified in one of the categories,
it is seldom the case that they perfectly fit into it, having some
features that probably belong to a different one. Therefore we should
think of this classification as a fuzzy set with blurred border lines.
