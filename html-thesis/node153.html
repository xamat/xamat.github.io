DSPOOM as a Graphical Model of Computation
</H1>

<P>
As we have seen DSPOOM offers a completely object-oriented metamodel
for digital signal processing. Nevertheless, the consequence of applying
object-oriented modeling techniques to the signal domain not surprisingly
yields a Graphical Model of Computation.

<P>
We will now compare DSPOOM graphical model to those introduced in
section <A HREF="node34.html#sec:GraphicalMoCs">1.5</A>. In order to do so we will first
summarize the main properties of its graphical model:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>In the DSPOOM graphical MoC the main nodes in the graph correspond
to Processing objects.
</LI>
<LI>By connecting Ports from different Processing objects we are defining
the arcs in the graphical model.
</LI>
<LI>These arcs in the graph are interpreted as unbounded FIFO queues where
data tokens are written and read.
</LI>
<LI>Processing objects produce/consume from the FIFO queues in a synchronous
manner, when told to do so by the flow control entity.
</LI>
<LI>The data consumption/production rate of Processing objects is not
fixed
</LI>
<LI>This consumption rate may vary at run time.
</LI>
<LI>By connecting controls from different Processing objects we are also
defining a secondary set of arcs.
</LI>
<LI>Controls are transmitted using an event-driven mechanism as soon as
they are generated.
</LI>
<LI>Controls are not enqueued and they overwrite past values even if they
have not been read.
</LI>
</OL>
The first four properties in the list simply confirm the fact that
DSPOOM's graphical MoC is appropriate for signal processing as those
properties are shared by most existing graphical models that have
been used in this domain.

<P>
The fact that Processing objects can produce/consume different quantities
of data tokens leads us to observe that our model can be more easily
assimilated to Dataflow Networks (see <A HREF="node38.html#sub:Dataflow-Networks">1.5.1</A>).
The ``firing rules'' of Dataflow Networks are translated into
region sizes in the DSPOOM models. The quantity of data tokens to
be produced or consumed by a Processing object Port is specified by
giving its region a particular size. This is precisely what Dataflow
Networks firing rules usually specify.

<P>
But common Dataflow Networks such as Synchronous Dataflow Networks
have firing rules that are statically defined (see <A HREF="node39.html#sub:Synchronous-Dataflow-Networks">1.5.1</A>).
In order to have regions resizeable at run-time like those found in
DSPOOM we have to turn to Dynamic Dataflow Networks (see section <A HREF="node41.html#sub:Dynamic-Dataflow-Networks">1.5.1</A>). 

<P>
Note though, that the DSPOOM metamodel does not require all modeled
applications to have dynamically resizeable regions. That is why a
DSPOOM compliant model can be also assimilated to a Synchronous Dataflow
Network. Therefore, whether a DSPOOM model can be statically scheduled
or not is not a fundamental issue. As for the general case we will
ensure that scheduling can be dynamically performed. But in many applications,
and under some usually acceptable restrictions, static scheduling
can be performed. 

<P>
As a first conclusion, by looking at the first six properties and
taking into account the previous discussion we may conclude that DSPOOM's
graphical MoC is a:
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">``(possibly Dynamic) Dataflow Network''</SPAN>
<BR>
<P>
But the control mechanism in DSPOOM introduces some differences. Its
event-driven syntax introduces an extension to the basic Process Network
and Dataflow language. This extension though is almost identical to
that in Context-aware Process Networks (see section <A HREF="node43.html#sub:Context-Aware-Process-Networks">1.5.1</A>).
The asynchronous coordination introduced in that model in order to
be able to use context information to control KPN execution has the
same requirements and features than DSPOOM's control mechanism. The
interpretation given to controls in DSPOOM is slightly different as
controls are seen as events directly travelling from Processing object
to Processing object, without the need of an intermediate register
such as the one deployed in Context-aware Process Networks. But then
again, these are only implementation details as the basic and fundamental
behavior, illustrated by our properties 7 to 9, are fully compatible. 

<P>
Because of all this, we can say that DSPOOM's graphical model of computation
is equivalent to a:
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">``Context-aware (and possibly Dynamic) Dataflow Network''</SPAN>
<BR>
<P>
Note that until now we have consciously not mentioned the Data Node
issue exposed in section <A HREF="node147.html#sub:DSPOOM::Networks_and_Composites">4.1.3</A>.
We consider that issue as an implementation detail as far as DSPOOM's
graphical MoC is concerned. Anyway, it is interesting to discuss how
this affects the basic graphical model.

<P>
DSPOOM's Data Node introduces a variant on the basic graphical MoC
adding a secondary node type. In this layer, nodes in the graph can
be either Processing Nodes or Data Nodes. 

<P>

<P>
Because the benefits and applications of making this issue explicit
in DSPOOM's graphical MoC are not sufficiently clear we have chosen
not to base the model on its existence. Nevertheless it is interesting
to note, as a pointer for future work, that its inclusion makes our
graphical model resemble a Petri Net and particularly an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Object-Oriented
Petri Net</SPAN> (see section <A HREF="node36.html#sub:Petri-Nets">1.5.1</A>), where Data Nodes are
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">places</SPAN> and Processing objects are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transitions</SPAN>.
