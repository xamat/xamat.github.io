The Decoding Step (Content Interpretation)</A>
</H3>

<P>
The main task of the decoder is to interpret the information received
through the channel in order to be able to feed the Synthesizer with
the correct parameters. Encoded sound objects must be interpreted
and prepared for the next module requirements. A very common of such
requirements is that the Synthesizer does not expect to receive synchronous
Processing Data but rather asynchronous Controls. Because of this,
and as already illustrated in Figure <A HREF="node159.html#fig:Detailed-OOCTM-diagram">5.6</A>,
the Decoder may output either Processing Data or Controls depending
on the particular needs of the Synthesizer. In case of the Synthesizer
needing Controls the conversion from Processing Data to Controls is
performed by basically reading the incoming encoded objects and sequencing
them as events when the associated time tags correspond to the current
synthesis time. From here on we will assume that the Decoder will
by default work this way, outputting Controls that are sequenced from
Processing Data Sound Objects received through the channel. 

<P>
The transmitted stream may have a varying degree of abstraction that
will affect the way the receiver will respond. The stream may contain
from signal related processing data with associated low-level descriptors
to high-level processing data representing high-level classifying
descriptors. The way the receiver has to process the input stream
depends on how high or low-leveled the content description received
is. Two main processes are involved in bringing the description into
the optimal <SPAN  CLASS="textit">level: abstraction</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inference</SPAN>. We
will now detail their main characteristics.

<P>
If the decoder is input low-leveled descriptions, there are two options,
depending on the application requirements. The low-level descriptors
can be directly fed into the Synthesis engine or there can be an intermediate
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">abstraction process</SPAN>. At first sight it may seem that the first
approach is more sensible and obviously more economical. But it has
a inherent problem that is difficult to solve: if the description
is very low-level it also has to be exhaustive and this, in many situations,
is not easy to accomplish or is not worth it in terms of channel bandwidth
(we may end-up having a description that is a few times the original
size). An example of a situation where a non-exhaustive low-leveled
description is received would be an input like ``sound object,
centroid=120Hz''. It is obvious that many sound objects comply with
this low-level description, the decoder would be in charge of adjusting
other necessary parameters.

<P>
For all those reasons it may be usually interesting to include the
intermediate abstraction process. In this process the decoder has
to use 'real world' knowledge in order to convert low-level information
into mid-level information, more understandable from the synthesizer
point of view. If the abstraction process is omitted and the synthesizer
receives low-level information but this description is not exhaustive,
those parameters not specified should be taken as default. Thus, paradoxically,
the synthesizer is granted some degrees of freedom and the result
may loose concretion.

<P>
On the other hand, if the input to the decoder consists only of high-level
semantic information, an intermediate <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inference process</SPAN> is
always needed in order to make the content description understandable
by the synthesis engine. This process, contrary of the abstraction
process earlier mentioned, might be better understood by using an
example. Imagine the decoder's input is 'violin.note'. The synthesizer
will be unable to interpret that content description because of its
degree of abstraction. The decoder is therefore forced to lower the
level of abstraction by suppressing degrees of freedom. The output
of the decoder should be something like 'violin note, pitch: C4, loudness:
mf'.

<P>
Both abstraction and inference are indeed one-to-many process, that
is, the same input should yield a finite set of different outputs.
The way the decoding process gets rid of the degrees of freedom should
rely on user or application preferences as well as on random processes
or context awareness. In the previous example, the decision on the
note and loudness to be played could be based on knowledge on the
author, the style, the user's likes, previous or future notes, harmony
and a final random process to choose one of the best alternatives.

<P>
In any case, the decoder must translate the input metadata into some
sort of synthesis language that can be easily interpreted by the synthesizer.
Therefore the key point of the language used for expressing synthesis
parameters is that it must not only meet the requirements of the synthesizer's
input but also the needs of the decoder's output. Note that this translation
means in most cases a translation from Processing Data into asynchronous
control events as most synthesis languages handle simple events, not
complex synchronous data.
