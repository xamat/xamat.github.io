Processing infrastructure
</H3>

<P>
All algorithms in CLAM are encapsulated in a class derived from the
abstract <TT>Processing</TT> base class. Thus it can be said that
every concrete derived class is a ``Processing class'' and each
of its instances is a ``Processing object''. The main goal of
this abstract class is to minimize the developer's effort when introducing
a new algorithm while enforcing good programming practices that produces
a code that results both efficient and understandable. For this reason,
the class provides some services and enforces some particular implementations
through its interface.

<P>
The Processing base class forces all derived classes to implement
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">port</SPAN> mechanism. Processing objects communicate with other
Processing objects through the use of ports. Input ports introduce
data into a Processing unit and the result of the process is written
into the output port. 

<P>
All concrete Processing classes also need to declare a related configuration
class. This class is derived from the base <TT>ProcessingConfig</TT>
class and its name is recommended to be the same as the one of its
associated Processing class adding the ``Config'' suffix. In some
cases several processing classes may share the same configuration
class. The FFT is a clear example of this. For example, several FFT
classes exist for different algorithm implementations in the CLAM
repository, but they all derive from a common <TT>FFT_base</TT> class,
and they share a common configuration class: <TT>FFTConfig</TT>.

The configuration will be used for initializing the Processing object
before its execution. For enforcing the use of this configuration
mechanism, the base Processing class declares a <TT>ConcreteConfigure()</TT>
pure virtual method that must be implemented in any concrete derived
class. In this method all initialization operations related to the
configuration stage must be implemented. As a matter of fact, the
configuration is accomplished by calling the <TT>Configure()</TT>
operation in the base class. This operation implements the Template
Method design pattern [<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>]: general operations like internal
state modification is modified in the base class while concrete and
particular configuration issues are delegated to each derived class.
It is also very common for Processing classes to keep an internal
copy of the configuration object to be able to respond when queried
about their current configuration.

<P>
Two operations are used in order to get a Processing into execution
state and to force it to leave this state: <TT>Start()</TT> and <TT>Stop()</TT>.
These operations also implement the Template Method design pattern
by implementing the default behavior (i.e. a simple change of state)
in the base class and leaving specific issues to the <TT>ConcreteStart()</TT>
and <TT>ConcreteStop()</TT> method in derived classes. These methods,
though, are not abstract and its implementation is therefore not mandatory.

<P>
Processing classes must provide two constructors: a default constructor
and a constructor with the configuration class as its argument type.
In most cases the former will call the <TT>Configure</TT> operation
with a default constructed configuration while the second will call
it passing the received configuration object. It is also usual to
include some explicit calls to member constructors for initializing
members like Controls or Ports that do not have default constructors.
Apart from that, most of the initialization functionality will be
left to the <TT>ConcreteConfigure()</TT> method.

<P>
The main execution methods in a Processing class are the <TT>Do</TT>
methods. They are the ones which actually perform the processing action.

<P>
There are two different kinds of <TT>Do</TT> methods:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A <TT>Do(void)</TT> method, with no arguments. This is the standard
way of using Processing objects connected to a Network (see <A HREF="node118.html#sec:_Network_Infrastructure">3.2.2</A>).
</LI>
<LI><TT>Do(...)</TT> methods taking data objects as arguments. They will
have some input data arguments first, and then some output data arguments.
A typical processing class will need a single <TT>Do</TT> method of
this kind. 
</LI>
</OL>
Both kinds of <TT>Do()</TT> methods operate in the same way: they
read a certain number of data objects from each of the inputs, and
write a certain number of data objects to each of the outputs. The
difference is that the non-network <TT>Do()</TT> method takes this
data objects as arguments (and thus does not use ports), while the
network <TT>Do()</TT> method has no arguments, an accesses the Data
through the Ports objects. It is very usual that this latter version
of the <TT>Do</TT> operation calls the explicit argument version after
having extracted the data from the corresponding ports.
