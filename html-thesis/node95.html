CLAM as an Object-Oriented Framework</A>
</H2>

<P>
CLAM is both a black-box and white-box framework (see section <A HREF="node26.html#sec:FrameworkClassification">1.3.3</A>
for a definition of these terms). But as already mentioned, this is
a common property of all software frameworks. It is a black-box framework
in the sense that already built-in components can be connected with
minimum programmer-effort in order to build new applications. And
it is white-box in the sense that abstract classes can be derived
in order to extend the framework components with new processes or
data containers.

<P>
CLAM is a framework for audio and music programming. It offers a general
infrastructure that can be used for any signal processing application.
But the ready-to-use components and tools focus on the music and audio
domain.

<P>
The framework can be used to construct general audio or music applications
for end-users or artists. But its main focus in on developing prototype
applications for research purposes. CLAM can be used as a framework
for rapid prototyping, testing new algorithms or ideas and general
research on the music and audio field.

<P>
The framework is truly object-oriented and its design promotes and
to some extent ensures modularity, re-usability, separation of aspects,
and conceptual encapsulation. It is important to note that targeted
users of the framework are mainly signal processing engineers that
may not have acquired good programming and design practices before
they are exposed to the framework. A lot of care has been put in enforcing
these good practices and ensuring that the framework, when used as
white-box, is extended without violating its philosophy. For example,
data classes are declared using a mechanism called Dynamic Types (see
<A HREF="node114.html#sec:_DataInfrastructure">3.2.2</A>). For declaring a member attribute
in a Dynamic Type, a set of special macros must be used. These macros
(apart from doing much more interesting things that will later be
explained) expand a private attribute and GetX()-SetX() accessors
with a user-defined visibility.

<P>
Apart from the object-oriented metamodel, or rather as a consequence
of, CLAM presents and enforces a particular graphical Model of Computation.
The CLAM MoC helps engineers in modeling signal processing systems
and as a consequence has immediate benefits on both the analysis of
the system itself as its design and implementation. Both the object-oriented
model and the MoC derived from CLAM will be introduced in the next
chapter.

<P>
As already mentioned, CLAM is implemented in C++. This allows for
the design of very demanding or time-critical applications. Several
real-time applications such as a vocal processor with spectral analysis/synthesis
or a sax synthesizer have implemented in the framework. In these cases
implementations based on the framework have proven to be even more
efficient than the original implementations. 

<P>
CLAM is also completely cross-platform and portable. A CLAM application
developed in GNU/Linux is immediately portable to Microsoft Windows
and Mac OSX. Even system-level primitives such as access to sound
devices or multi-threading handling are encapsulated in such a way
that the target operating system is transparent to the user. 

<P>
The framework is also completely Free Software (as for the definition
given by the Free Software Foundation [<A
 HREF="node207.html#FSF">Free Software Foundation, </A>]) and licensed under
the GPL. Thus it can be used under no restriction as long as the resulting
application remains Free. Access is therefore granted to the source
code and the knowledge accumulated during the framework design process
is transmitted and reused without restriction.
