MetriX in XML= MetriXML
</H2>

<P>
The MetriX framework was ported to CLAM. This meant on one hand fitting
the MetriX object-oriented music model to the DSPOOM metamodel. As
it will be seen in this section, and has already been suggested earlier
on in this same chapter, this adaption was completely natural. On
the other hand, adapting MetriX to the CLAM framework implied gaining
XML representation ``for free''. Therefore, the substitution of
the textual format for XML was also natural. The overall process gave
place to MetriXML.

<P>
The first thing to do when adapting a previously existing model to
the DSPOOM metamodel is to identify what metaclass each of the model
elements belong to. In our case the basic model classes that should
find a DSPOOM metaclass are: <TT>Instrument</TT>, <TT>Generator</TT>,
<TT>Note</TT>, <TT>Event</TT>, and <TT>Score</TT>.

<P>
The relation of the first two classes with the DSPOOM metamodel are
as it was already illustrated in figure <A HREF="node183.html#fig:Instrument-in-DSPOOM">6.4</A>:
an <TT>Instrument</TT> is a ProcessingComposite made up of Processing
objects that are instances of the <TT>Generator</TT> subclass. Then
the question is how the Instrument definition expressed in MIDL (see
section <A HREF="node190.html#sub:MIDL">6.4.2</A> ) is related to the metamodel. The answer
is that an Instrument definition is a DSPOOM <TT>Configuration</TT>
that will be used to configure the <TT>Instrument</TT> Processing
object before its execution. Note that this configuration will also
be in charge of ``subclassifying'' the generic Instrument to a
particular one as shown in figure <A HREF="node183.html#fig:InstrumentHierarchy">6.1</A>.

<P>
The other subelements present in an Instrument such as the Timbre
Space or the Break Point Functions (see figure <A HREF="node189.html#cap:MetriX-Instrument-Class">6.10</A>)
will have no direct interpretation in the DSPOOM metamodel. On execution
time they play a secondary role as auxiliary mechanisms of the Instrument
and on configuration time they will already be represented by fields
in the overall configuration.

<P>
In a similar way, the <TT>Note</TT> class is seen as a conceptual
shortcut with no direct interpretation in the DSPOOM metamodel. As
a matter of fact a Note corresponds to the internal state of each
of the Generators. As such we should be able to query a Generator
for its Note-state, but no more direct access nor representation is
needed.

<P>
It is clear that a music <TT>Event</TT> should somehow relate to a
DSPOOM Control. But the representation of an Event in a Score, which
includes for instance a time tag, is too complex to make it directly
compatible with the simple asynchronous control mechanism based on
simple data types that is included in the DSPOOM metamodel. The solution
is the same that is usually recommended when this situation arises
in modeling a particular system in DSPOOM (see section <A HREF="node141.html#sub:Generators__Sinks_and_Transforms">4.1.1</A>).
First, a related Processing Data class must be defined. In our case,
the Event class will therefore be a Processing Data. Then we need
a special sink Processing object class that receives this incoming
Processing Data and converts it into DSPOOM control events. In our
case we will call this class the <TT>Scheduler</TT>.

<P>
The <TT>Scheduler</TT> is the class responsible for receiving input
Events as Processing Data, enqueueing them if necessary, and firing
DSPOOM control events when it corresponds according to their time
tag and the system current time.

<P>
Finally, the <TT>Score</TT> class contains Events that have already
been defined as Processing Data objects. It naturally derives that
the Score is also a Processing Data class. Figure <A HREF="#fig:MetriXML-DSPOOM">6.11</A>
illustrates the class diagram of the MetriXML model in terms of the
DSPOOM metamodel.

<P>
As explained in section <A HREF="node114.html#sec:_DataInfrastructure">3.2.2</A> any Configuration
implemented in CLAM has automatic XML passivation services. 

<P>
In the following subsections we will illustrate the process of converting
the MetriX textual formats into XML and finding the Object-Oriented
Model related to them. For doing so, both for the MetriX Instrument
Definition Language and MetriX Score Definition Language we will follow
the following steps:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>First, we will translate the examples given in previous sections for
the textual formats into XML.
</LI>
<LI>Then we will abstract the format model and specify it in XML Schema.
</LI>
<LI>Using the XML Schema abstract specification we will derive the OO
model that will be illustrated in an UML class diagram.
