Conclusions
and Future Work
</H1>

<P>
In this Thesis we have presented a metamodel for digital signal processing
named DSPOOM. 

<P>
This metamodel uses the Object-Oriented paradigm and exploits the
relation between this paradigm and the Graphical Models of Computation
used mainly in system engineering. Because these and other concepts
used in the Thesis are borrowed from different areas of knowledge
it is first necessary to establish a coherent corpus and conceptual
framework. This is introduced in chapter <A HREF="node6.html#ch:_FoundationalIssues">1</A>.
We believe that this chapter cannot be only understood as a conceptual
introduction, though. The way that the different concepts are presented
and related in between them constitutes a set of hypotheses in itself,
hypotheses that are then elaborated and demonstrated in the following
chapters. The main hypothesis can be summarized in: ``Systems are
object-oriented''; ``Signal processing systems can be modeled
through object-oriented and graphical models of computation''; and
``Frameworks generate metamodels''.

<P>
A metamodel cannot be defended in any other way than through the evaluation
of the models it generates and their usefulness for modeling systems
in a particular domain. In this Thesis this is accomplished through
the CLAM framework. CLAM, which is a framework for music and audio
processing, is as a matter of fact the origin of the DSPOOM metamodel
that was obtained as an abstraction of the framework and the different
models included in it. In chapter <A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A> we have presented
the main features of the CLAM framework and we have compared them
to some included in similar frameworks. For doing so we have had to
first present a thorough review of similar environments in chapter
<A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A>. As already pointed out in the corresponding
chapter we believe that CLAM represents a different approach based
especially on the use of good software engineering techniques.

<P>
The Digital Signal Processing Object-Oriented Metamodel (DSPOOM) is
an abstraction of different conceptual conclusions we reached during
the framework development process. Nevertheless it shares many concepts
and ideas with the frameworks reviewed in this thesis. It presents
a clear way to model a signal processing system while it enhances
the separation between data and process, and idea that is intuitive
to signal processing engineers. It also offers and explicit graphical
Model of Computation that helps in modeling complex systems and understanding
them.

<P>
The Object-Oriented Content Transmission Metamodel is a particular
instance of DSPOOM that can be used to model the so-called ``Content-based
applications''. The OOCTM is also demonstrated through some particular
applications that partially instantiate the metamodel. The applicability
of the whole metamodel is still not guaranteed as it depends on some
ongoing research that is supposed to develop the necessary technology
for some of the building blocks. Nevertheless we believe that the
conceptual framework is useful in itself and will help in understanding
also the practical applicability of the metamodel.

<P>
Finally the object-oriented music model presented through the MetriX
language is a particular model that can be understood as a proof of
concept that object-orientation in general and DSPOOM in particular
can be used to effectively model more abstract domains such as music.
Although the scope of this music model is not as broad as to give
response to any musical application and its implementation presents
some limitations, we believe it is generic enough so as to become
useful in most situations with a few minor additions (see again section
<A HREF="node206.html#ch:_Future_Work">6.5</A> on Future Work)

<P>
After this concluding conceptual summary we will finish this section
by completing the glossary given at the Introduction and by outlining
possible lines of future work.
