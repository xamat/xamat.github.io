Kristen Nygaard and the Scandinavian School: Object-Orientation
as a system simulation tool</A>
</H3>

<P>
Simula I is usually referred to as the first object-oriented language.
Nevertheless, in Simula I the words <SPAN  CLASS="textit">objects</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">classes</SPAN>
were never used. Instead objects were called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">processes</SPAN> and
classes <SPAN  CLASS="textit">activities</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#NygaardTeachingOO">Nygaard, 2001</A>]. Simula I aimed
at being a system description language and a programming language
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#NyggardBasicOOConcepts">Nygaard, 1986</A>]. The original goals of the authors
was to create a language that included definitions of basic concepts,
allowed a formal description of any system, and in which system descriptions
should be easy to read and useful for communication [<A
 HREF="node207.html#DahlNygaardSimula">Dahl and Nygaard, 1966</A>].
The interest of converting Simula into a general purpose language,
more than just a simulation language, and the idea of adding inheritance
capabilities between <SPAN  CLASS="textit">activities</SPAN> brought up a new version of
Simula called Simula 67 [<A
 HREF="node207.html#NygaardDevelopmentOfSimula">Nygaard and Dahl, 1978</A>].

<P>
By reading the (very few) articles that the main authors of the Simula
language, Nygaard and Dahl, wrote it is clear that they were conscious
of the definition of a system as a set of interacting objects and
the role of object-orientation as a modeling or simulation paradigm.
What follows can be read as a summary of the Scandinavian school of
object-orientation extracted from [<A
 HREF="node207.html#NygaardDevelopmentOfSimula">Nygaard and Dahl, 1978</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#NygaardTeachingOO">Nygaard, 2001</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#NyggardBasicOOConcepts">Nygaard, 1986</A>]and
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#DahlNygaardSimula">Dahl and Nygaard, 1966</A>]. In this description we will concentrate
on the basic ideas that led to the formulation of the object-oriented
paradigm but will also include some definitions of concepts that are
useful for my dissertation.

<P>
According to Nygaard, the idea that led to Simula and object-oriented
programming was to create a language that made it possible for people
to comprehend, describe, and communicate about systems and to analyze
existing and proposed systems through computer based models. The basic
concept in Simula is the process, being characterized by a data structure
and an operation rule. The individual members of the data structure
of a process were called attributes. Simula I was mostly used as a
system description language. Most of the time, it was used as a way
to gather more information about the system under study and understand
it better.

<P>
At first, Simula defined a system as containing active components
(<SPAN  CLASS="textit">stations</SPAN>) and passive components (<SPAN  CLASS="textit">costumers</SPAN>). A costumer
was generated by the service part of a station, transferred to the
queue part of another... The whole structure was called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">network</SPAN>
and actions from stations were regarded as happening in discrete moments
in time therefore becoming discrete event networks. Then the idea
of network was substituted by the more powerful concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">model</SPAN>,
consisting of processes that were declared collectively by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">activity</SPAN>
declarations.

<P>
Nygaard was not very keen on using the term <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Computer Science</SPAN>,
he preferred to ad-scribe himself to the discipline of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Informatics</SPAN>.
He had a personal discourse about the meaning of the word and the
discipline itself that is interesting for us to understand the whole
idea behind object-orientation. Informatics is an applied or empirical
science. While mathematics is about relations between specified quantities
and operations valid in specified domains, Informatics is about processes
and the description of their state transitions. Informatics should
be defined like most other sciences (like physics, chemistry, botany,
sociology or political science but unlike mathematics) as the study
by scientific methods of a domain of phenomena and a perspective selecting
a set of characteristics of those phenomena. And the particular perspective
selected by Informatics is that of the information aspects or processes.
So Informatics is not an abstract science, it is related to real-world
phenomena.

<P>
If we follow this intellectual discussion and continue defining some
of the terms and concepts that already appeared in the previous definition
we will end up getting to the concept of model itself. We just mentioned
that Informatics is related to real-world phenomena. But what is a
phenomenon? A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">phenomenon</SPAN> is defined by Nygaard as a thing that
has definite, individual existence in reality or the mind, anything
real in itself. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">concept</SPAN> is a generalized idea of a collection
of phenomena, based on knowledge of common properties of instances
in the collection. A concept is defined by its extension (the collection
of phenomena that the concept covers), intension (the collection of
properties that characterize the phenomena represented by the concept)
and designation (the collection of names by which the concept is known).
A phenomenon M is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">model</SPAN> of a phenomenon R, according to some
perspective P, if a person regards M and R as similar according to
P. M is called the model, R the referent and P is the perspective.

<P>
In the first definition, we also mentioned the idea of process. We
will now dive into it and discover its relation to systems. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">process</SPAN>
is a phenomenon that we choose to regard as a development of a part
of the world through transformations during a time interval called
its life span. The basic qualities of a process are: its substance,
its states, its transitions, and its structure. A state of an information
process is expressed by describing: - the moment at which the state
is recorded, its substance, measurement of properties and transformations
going on, all at that moment. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">structure</SPAN> of the process
is the limitations of its sets of states and thus of its possible
sequences of states. A process is regarded as an information process
when the qualities considered are: its substance, the physical matter
that it transforms, the state of its substance, in terms of measurable
properties, the results of measurements represented by values, its
transitions, the transformations of its substance and thus of its
state.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">system</SPAN> is a part of the world that is regarded as a whole,
its substance consisting of components, each components state characterized
by the states of properties, called attributes, that are selected
as being relevant, and by state transitions relating to these attributes
and to other components and their attributes.

<P>
In object oriented programming an information process is regarded
as a system developing through transformations of its state. The substance
of the process is organized as the system components, called objects.
A measurable property of the substance is a property of an object.
Transformations of state are regarded as actions by objects. The substance
of the system is organized as objects, building the system's components.
All attributes of the substance are properties of objects. Transitions
- transformations of state - are regarded as being the result of actions
of objects.

As a conclusion, the basic ideas behind object orientation that make
it different from other perspectives, is that: (1) A program execution
is regarded as a physical model system simulating the behavior of
either a real or imaginary part of the world; (2) physical modeling
is based upon the conception of reality in terms of phenomena and
concepts (3) a physical model system is constructed, modeling phenomena
by objects and concepts by categories of objects or classes.

<P>
At this point it is also important to highlight another important
figure: Alan Kay. Apart from also being considered one of the most
important people in the birth of object-orientation, Alan Kay is also
the father of modern graphical user interfaces and the laptop, the
main creator of the Smalltalk programming language and the author
of such famous sentences as ``the best way to predict future is
to invent it''. In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#Kay">Kay, 1993</A>] he summarizes Smalltalk, and therefore
object-orientation, in the following principles:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Everything is an object
</LI>
<LI>Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages (in terms of
objects)
</LI>
<LI>Objects have their own internal memory (in terms of objects)
</LI>
<LI>Every object is an instance of a class (which in turn must be an object)
</LI>
<LI>The class holds the shared behavior for its instances
</LI>
<LI>To evaluate a program list control is passed to the first object and
the remainder is treated as its message.
</LI>
</UL>
What is particularly interesting for our discussion is the fact that
at the time of formulating the basis of the object-oriented paradigm
he was very much interested in system simulation after his work in
the Air Force and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Furthermore,
he also acknowledges the deep influence that the Simula language had
on his ideas and he explicitly mentions the relation between object-orientation
and system modeling when stating that ``object-oriented design
is a successful attempt to qualitatively improve the efficiency of
modeling the ever more complex dynamic systems and user relationships...''
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#Kay">Kay, 1993</A>].

<P>
Other renowned authors have also highlighted this relation between
object-orientation and simulation. Timothy Budd in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BuddOOProgramming">Budd, 1991</A>]
describes the existing relationship between object-oriented programming
and discrete event simulation. He finishes the discussion stating
that ``computation is simulation''.
