Visualization</A>

<P>
Just as almost any other framework in any domain, CLAM had to think
about ways of integrating the core of the framework tools with a graphical
user interface that may be used as a front-end of the framework functionalities.

<P>
The usual way to work around this issue is to decide on a graphical
toolkit or framework and add support to it, offering ways of connecting
the framework under development to the widgets and other graphical
tools included in the graphical framework. In CLAM though we aimed
at offering an toolkit-independent support. This is accomplished through
the CLAM Visualization Module.

<P>
In order to do so a variant of the Model-View-Controller architectural
pattern was implemented. In this new version the main actors are the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Presentation</SPAN>, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Model Adapter</SPAN>, and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Model
Controller</SPAN>.

<P>
A Presentation is a graphical metaphor through which some information
contained in the model object is shown to the user. A Presentation
can be anything from a simple widget to a full application graphical
interface, depending on the complexity of the model object to be presented.
A Presentation can be activated and deactivated, therefore its existence
does not imply its visibility.

<P>
The <TT>ModelAdapter</TT> class defines the interface that is common
to all model object adapters in CLAM Visualization Module. It offers
the interface required by the Observable actor in the GOF Observer
pattern [<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>]. The Adapter concept was chosen in order not to
taint the model object interface and to separate effectively the model
objects from its representation. The main operation in the <TT>ModelAdapter</TT>
class is the abstract <TT>Publish</TT> operation that must be implemented
in all subclasses in order to publish the updated model object internal
state.

<P>
The <TT>ModelController</TT> class is similar to the <TT>ModelAdapter</TT>
except in that, besides from publishing the model object state, it
also allows to modify it. For that reason it adds the <TT>Update</TT>
operation to the previously mentioned <TT>Publish</TT>.

<P>
The CLAM Visualization Module also implements a Signal&amp;Slots mechanism
similar to that offered by frameworks such as QT [<A
 HREF="node207.html#QTProgramming">Blanchette and Summerfield, 2004</A>].
The basic rationale behind the Signal&amp;Slot mechanism is the following:
Sometimes it is required that an object notifies a change in internal
state or the reception of a message to any number of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">listeners</SPAN>.
This situation can be modeled in different ways but most of them suffer
from a major drawback: coupling. In this sense, the caller must know
to some extent the callee interface. Because of this, reuse capabilities
are reduced. The Signal&amp;Slot idiom gives solution to this problem.
The Signal models the concept of ``event notifying'', and signals
are connected to Slots that represent ``event handlers''.

<P>
In CLAM the Signal&amp;Slot idiom is implemented through three main classes:
the <TT>Signal</TT> class, the <TT>Slot</TT> class and the <TT>Connection</TT>
class. The <TT>Signal</TT> and <TT>Slot</TT> classes model the obvious
concepts previously explained. On the other hand, the <TT>Connection</TT>
class models the knowledge a signal has about who has to be notified
whenever a client invokes the <TT>Emit()</TT> operation on it. Each
time a <TT>Signal</TT> and <TT>Slot</TT> objects are bound together
a <TT>Connection</TT> object is created, tagged by a Global Unique
IDentifierIdentifier (GUID). This particular implementation was loosely
derived from [<A
 HREF="node207.html#HickeyCallbacks">Hickey, 1995</A>].

<P>
Apart from the previous tools, the non-dependency from graphical toolkit
implementation is also accomplished through the use of a Widget Toolkit
Wrapper. This Creator/Singleton class produces objects that are abstract
wrappers for accessing a GUI Toolkit low-level functionality such
as triggering the event loop, triggering the execution of a single
iteration of the event loop or setting the refresh rate for graphic
displays.

<P>
All this general Visualization infrastructure is completed by some
already implemented presentations and widgets. These are offered both
for the FLTK toolkit [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-FLTK">www-FLTK, </A>] and the QT framework [<A
 HREF="node207.html#QTProgramming">Blanchette and Summerfield, 2004</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-QT">www-QT, </A>].
An example of such utilities are convenience debugging tools called
Plots are also offered. Plots offer ready-to-use independent widgets
that include the presentation of the main Processing Data's in the
CLAM framework such as audio and spectrum.
