Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we have presented the Digital Signal Processing Object-Oriented
Metamodel (DSPOOM). This metamodel may be considered the main contribution
of this thesis and is basically a result of abstracting the conceptual
results found in the CLAM framework.

<P>
DSPOOM combines the advantages of the object-oriented paradigm with
system engineering techniques and particularly with graphical Models
of Computation in order to offer a generic metamodel that can be instantiated
to model any kind of signal processing related system.

<P>
To do so the metamodel presents a classification of signal processing
objects into two basic categories: objects that process or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing</SPAN>
objects and objects that hold data or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing Data</SPAN> objects.
Processing objects represent the object-oriented encapsulation of
a process or algorithm. They include support for synchronous data
processing and asynchronous event-driven control processing as well
as a configuration mechanism and a explicit life cycle. Data input
and output to Processing objects is done through <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ports</SPAN> and
control data is handled through the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Control</SPAN> mechanism. On the
other hand Processing Data objects must offer a homogeneous getter/setter
interface and support for meta object facilities such as reflection
and automatic serialization services.

<P>
The metamodel also presents mechanisms for composing statically and
dynamically with basic DSPOOM objects. Static compositions are called
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing Composites</SPAN> and dynamic compositions are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Networks</SPAN>.

<P>
Finally the DSPOOM metamodel can also be considered as an object-oriented
implementation of a graphical Model of Computation, particularly the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Context-aware Dataflow Networks</SPAN>.

<P>
We may therefore conclude that the metamodel here described presents
a comprehensive conceptual framework to model signal processing systems
and applications. The metamodel has already had its practical validation
with the CLAM framework presented in the previous chapter. Therefore,
and although we believe in the metamodel generality, it has only been
validated in the audio and music domain.
