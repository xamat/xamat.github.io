Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we have presented an object-oriented music model that
can be interpreted as an instance of the basic Digital Signal Processing
Object-Oriented Metamodel dealing in this case with higher-level symbolic
musical data.

<P>
Following again the object-oriented paradigm we model a music system
as a set of interrelated objects. These objects will in general belong
to one of the following abstract classes: Instrument, Generator, Note
or Score.

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument</SPAN> is a generating Processing object that receives
input controls and generates an output sound. An Instrument is as
a matter of fact a logical grouping of autonomous units named <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Generators</SPAN>.
A Generator is the atomic sound producing unit in an Instrument and
can be independently controlled from the other Generators (although
it often receives their influence). Examples are the six strings in
a guitar or each of the keys in a piano.

<P>
A Note is the actual sounding object attached to each Generator. A
Note can be turned on and off and its properties depend on the internal
state of its associated Generator and Instrument.

<P>
Finally the internal state of the whole object-oriented music system
changes in response to events that are sent to particular Instruments
or Generators. A time-ordered collection of such events is known as
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Score</SPAN>.

<P>
The abstract model just described is implemented in the MetriX language
or in its XML-based version MetriX-ML. MetriX-ML is a Music-N language
that therefore offers a way of defining both Instruments and Scores.
It is implemented in CLAM and, apart from the concepts previously
presented, includes support for defining timbre spaces, break-point-functions
and relations between control parameters in an Instrument.

<P>
Therefore the model and its implementation is fully usable. Nevertheless
the model is not complete as it has not been adapted to different
synthesis techniques apart from Spectral Modelling Synthesis. But
its definition and implementation in the context of the CLAM framework
make it extensible and adaptable to future needs.

<P>
