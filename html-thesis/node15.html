The Vocal Processor Experience</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Vocal Processor was a research project developed in our group
for the Yamaha Company, Japan. The Vocal Processor is a VST plugin
for singing voice processing that implements spectral domain techniques.
It is designed to run on real-time and, because of its complex algorithms,
demands many computer resources.

<P>
The initial implementation was done in C++ but the code was highly
unstructured and hardly maintainable. For that reason it was decided
to port the code to the CLAM framework (see chapter <A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A>).
Once the VST plugin was running in its CLAM version, it was discovered
that this implementation was almost one hundred percent slower. The
first impression was that the Object-Oriented techniques and overall
design of the framework were causing this and that it would not be
possible to compete with the fine-tuned but highly unstructured original
code. The process that followed, and demonstrated that other reasons
were behind that bad performance, illustrates the overall message
of this section.

<P>
None of the efficiency problems found in this application were related
to any of the previously mentioned prejudices against object-orientation:
encapsulation, modularity, or inheritance. As a matter of fact, having
a clear and clean design and code enabled a fast refactoring that
ended up in having a fully object-oriented CLAM version of the plugin
that was even about thirty percent faster than the original one.

<P>
Using specialized profiling tools, the efficiency hotspots were found.
These are the main actions that had to be taken in order to improve
the first CLAM version:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Algorithm improvement: some algorithms were not well implemented and
contained efficiency bugs. These efficiency bugs were usually related
to unnecessary memory allocations and independent loops.
</LI>
<LI>VST interface improvement: the incoming data from the VST host was
not being correctly handled and this meant having unnecessary memory
allocations of large memory blocks.
</LI>
<LI>Inefficient low level routines: the Microsoft Windows implementation
of some low level routines such as float to integer conversion or
absolute number were causing an overall slow down of the process.
Surprisingly, this was one of the most significant factors. Such functions
were being called millions of times during the whole process and the
overall effect was really worrying. We finally ended up implementing
these routines in assembler code.
</LI>
<LI>Compiler settings. The VST plugin was being compiled for Windows with
the Microsoft Visual Studio environment. This compiler has some obscure
settings that had to be tuned in order to find the best combination.
</LI>
<LI>Incorrect thread handling.
</LI>
</OL>
From this use case it is clear that the object-oriented paradigm did
not introduce any efficiency trap. Furthermore, it facilitated the
improvement of the original code because of its modularity and clear
structure.
