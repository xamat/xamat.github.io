<P>
Apart from the main sample applications CLAM has been used in many
different projects that are not included in the public version either
because the projects themselves have not reached an stable stage or
because their results are protected by non-disclosure agreements with
third parties. In this section we will outline these other users of
CLAM.

<P>
The Time Machine project implemented a high quality time stretching
algorithm that was later integrated and included in a commercial product
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#TimeMachineICMC">Bonada, 2000</A>]. The algorithm uses multi-band processing
and works in real-time. It is a clear example of how the core of CLAM
processing can be used in isolation as it lacks of any GUI or audio
input/output infrastructure.

<P>
The Vocal Processor (see figure <A HREF="#cap:The-Vocal-Processor">3.15</A>) is
a prototype also developed for a third party. It is a VST plug-in
for singing voice transformations. It includes transformations such
as smart harmonization, hoarseness, whispering or formant change.
This prototype was a chance to test CLAM integration into VST API
and also to check the efficiency of the framework in highly demanding
situations (see <A HREF="node14.html#sec:_OO_efficiency">1.1.5</A>). Most transformations are
implemented in the frequency domain and the plug-in must work in real-time
consuming as few resources as possible.

The CUIDADO IST European project [<A
 HREF="node207.html#Cuidado">Vinet et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>] was completely developed
with CLAM. The focus of the project was on automatic analysis of audio
files. In particular rhythmic and melodic descriptions were implemented.
The CLAM code was integrated as a binary dll into a commercial product
named the Sound Palette (see figure <A HREF="#cap:The-Sound-Palette">3.16</A>).
The algorithms and research applications are currently being integrated
into the CLAM project and incorporated into standalone sample applications
such as the Swinger, an application that computes rhythmic descriptors
from a sound file and applying a time-stretching algorithm is able
to change the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">swing</SPAN> of the piece (see figure <A HREF="#cap:The-Swinger">3.17</A>).

The Open Drama project was another IST European project that used
CLAM extensively. The project focus was on finding new interactive
ways to present opera. In particular, a prototype application called
MDTools was built to create an MPEG-7 compliant description of a complete
opera play (see figure <A HREF="#cap:MD-Tools">3.18</A>).

The AudioClass project aims at building automatic tools for managing
large collections of audio effects. Analysis algorithms implemented
in CLAM have been integrated and are called from a web application.
The results are then added to a large metadata database.

<P>
Also CLAM is being used for educational purposes in different ways.
On one hand, it is the base for a course on Music and Audio Programming.
On the other hand it is the base of many Master Thesis. In this context,
it has been used for applications such as Voice-to-MIDI conversion,
Timbre Space based synthesis and morph, or song identification. All
these results are by definition public and will be integrated into
the public repository.

<P>
Finally, CLAM is also currently being used in different internal projects
that will also someday be integrated. Probably the most important
is the SIMAC IST European project. The software output of this project
will be three prototypes: a music annotator application, a music collection
organizer and browser, and a music recommendation engine. All of them
are being developed in CLAM.

<P>
Rappid [<A
 HREF="node207.html#RAPPID">Robledo, 2002</A>] is a testing workbench for the CLAM framework
in high demanding situations. The first version of Rappid implements
a quite simple time-domain amplitude modulation algorithm. Any other
CLAM based algorithm, though, can be used in its place. Next picture
illustrates the basic diagrams of the application. The most interesting
thing about Rappid is the way that multithreading issues are handled,
using a watchdog mechanism. The current implementation works only
under GNU/Linux. Rappid has been tested in a live-concert situation.
Gabriel Brnic used Rappid as a essential part of his composition for
harp, viola and tape, presented at the Multiphonies 2002 cycle of
concerts in Paris.
