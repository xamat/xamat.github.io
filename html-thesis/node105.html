SpectralPeak and SpectralPeakArray</A>
</H4>

<P>
A <TT>SpectralPeak</TT> is a very basic storage PD class that has
the following attributes: scale, frequency, magnitude, phase, bin
position, and bin width. It has also some operators such as product,
distance and log/linear scale converting routines. By itself it is
seldom used and should be preferably used through the <TT>SpectralPeakArray</TT>
class.

<P>
The <TT>SpectralPeakArray</TT> is not, as its name may imply, just
a simple array of <TT>SpectralPeaks</TT>. As a matter of fact, the
<TT>SpectralPeakArray</TT> class does not hold <TT>SpectralPeak</TT>
inside but rather a set of buffers containing magnitude, frequency,
phase, bin position, bin width and index. This representation has
been chosen for efficiency reasons in order to be able to operate
on contiguous memory.

<P>
Apart from these buffers, it includes other attributes such as <TT>Scale</TT>,
<TT>nPeaks</TT> (number of peaks currently available) and <TT>nMaxPeaks</TT>
(maximum number of peaks allowed). 

<P>
Even though the most efficient way to deal with a peak array is working
directly on the buffers , two accessory interfaces are offered: first,
you can access/modify any of the attributes of a given peak by using
the interface offered by methods like <TT>GetMag(index)</TT> or <TT>SetPhase(index)</TT>;
but also, you can use an interface using <TT>SpectralPeak</TT> objects
through the <TT>GetSpectralPeak(index)</TT> and <TT>SetSpectralPeak(index)</TT>
methods. Note that these methods do not return a pre-existing peak
but rather construct the peak object on the fly. Therefore, they are
far from efficient.

<P>
Another particularity that needs mention is the <TT>IndexArray</TT>.
It is a multi-purpose array of indices that is used for fundamental
detection, peak continuation and track assigning. It is sometimes
indeed a very convenient way of dealing with many insertions/deletions
of peaks into the array as they can be substituted by a simple change
in index. The <TT>SpectralPeakArray</TT> class offers an accessory
interface (consisting of several methods) for working through indices.
