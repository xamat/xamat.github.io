Data and Control Flow
</H3>

<P>
While a Processing object is in the Running state it will receive,
process and produce two different kinds of information:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Synchronous data: That will be fed from and to the Ports every time
a Do method is called. Processing objects consume Processing Data
through their input Ports and produce Processing Data to their output
Ports.
</LI>
<LI>Asynchronous data: Fed from and to the Controls whenever a control
event happens. They usually change the internal state/mode of the
algorithm
</LI>
</UL>
These two kinds of data clearly define two different graphs and flow
control policies. We will now explain how these kinds of data affect
a Processing object and will leave flow control issues to future sections
(see section on Networks in <A HREF="node147.html#sub:DSPOOM::Networks_and_Composites">4.1.3</A>).

<P>
Processing objects consume Processing Data through their input Ports,
process it and leave the result in their output Ports. The Processing
Data is consumed and produced in response to a call to the Do operation
therefore when receiving such a message the Processing object must
have valid data in its inputs and must have a valid location where
to write the result.

<P>
It is important to note that in DSPOOM a data token is the atomic
partition of any processing data that refers to an instant in time.
Therefore a whole spectrum, whatever its size, is a data token. But
a chunk of audio is not considered a token as its data spreads over
time, in this case the data token is each of its sample. Processing
objects though, do not consume a unique, not even fixed, amount of
data tokens. Each processing object may configure the size of the
data chunk needed for a single execution. A processing may need n
spectrums or n audio samples in order to produce a valid output. In
section <A HREF="node142.html#sub:DSPOOM::Processing_Data">4.1.2</A> we will review the main
features and services that these Processing Data objects must offer
in the context of a DSPOOM metamodel.

<P>
Ports in a processing may be also understood as pointers that point
to somewhere where the data to be processed is located (usually a
memory location). If both the outport and one of the inputs are pointing
to the same location, the processing object is said to be processing
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">inplace</SPAN>. Not all the processing objects have the ability of
processing inplace as this greatly depends on the algorithm that they
encapsulate. Furthermore, input and output ports do not even have
to be the same kind: the transformation or process introduced by the
processing object on the incoming data can be so structural that even
the data kind may change (e.g. a processing object may convert an
input ``tree'' into and output ``piece of furniture'').

<P>
But, as already mentioned, apart from the synchronous data flow, Processing
objects can respond to an asynchronous flow of events. This mechanism
is encapsulated in the concept of Controls. A Processing object may
have any number of input controls and output Controls. An input Control
affects the non-structural aspect of the Processing object state.
This means that the reception of an input Control does not produce
a transition from one of the four main states to another, it rather
produces an inter-state transition from one of the possible sub-states
to the other. On the other hand, output Controls maybe generated at
any time although it is usual for them to be the result of one of
the two following cases: (1) a response to a received input Control
or (2) a result of a particular algorithm that apart from (or instead
of) producing output data also generates a number of asynchronous
events.

<P>
Controls must also have a clear initial value. In most cases this
value is set in the construction of the owner Processing object. In
other cases, though it is interesting to associate this initial value
to a particular configuration parameter. The initialization of the
control value is performed in the Start transition so that every time
that the Stop/Start cycle is followed the control is able to return
to its initial value.

<P>
This distinction between data and control is directly related to the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">In-band Out-of-band Partitions</SPAN> pattern commented in section
<A HREF="node45.html#sub:Patterns-of-Graphical">1.5.3</A>.
