External libraries 
</H2>

<P>
We have already mentioned that one of the software engineering maximas
that CLAM observes is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reuse</SPAN>. When developing a framework everything
is designed with future reuse in mind. In a similar sense a framework
must reuse all possible pre-existing solutions. In CLAM we always
try not to fall onto the ``redesigning the wheel'' paradigm. Because
of this a number of external libraries that provide specific functionality
are used. In this section we will briefly describe their main features.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FFTW</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#FFTW98">Frigo and Johnson, 1998</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-FFTW">www-FFTW, </A>] is a C subroutine library for
computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions,
of both real and complex data, and of arbitrary input size. We believe
that FFTW, which is free software, should become the FFT library of
choice for most applications. Our benchmarks, performed on on a variety
of platforms, show that FFTW's performance is typically superior to
that of other publicly available FFT software. Moreover, FFTW's performance
is portable: the program will perform well on most architectures without
modification. Another FFT library that has been integrated into CLAM
is the new <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FFT-Ooura</SPAN>, which is almost as efficient as the
FFTW but has a BSD-style kind of license.

<P>
Two different graphical user interface toolkits have been in some
way integrated into the CLAM framework: FLTK and QT. The Fast and
Light ToolKit <SPAN  CLASS="textbf"></SPAN>(<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FLTK</SPAN>) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-FLTK">www-FLTK, </A>] (pronounced
&#34;fulltick&#34;) is a LGPL'd C++ graphical user interface
toolkit for X (UNIX), MacOS, and Microsoft Windows, that offers lightweight
solutions for building GUI's and supports 3D graphics with OpenGL.
It is currently maintained by a small group of developers across the
world with a central repository on SourceForge. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Qt</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#QTProgramming">Blanchette and Summerfield, 2004</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-QT">www-QT, </A>]
is a C++ framework for application development. It lets application
developers target all major operating systems with a single application
source code. Qt provides a platform-independent API to all central
platform functionality: GUI, database access, networking, file handling,
etc. The Qt library encapsulates the different APIs of different operating
systems, providing the application programmer with a single, common
API for all operating systems. The native C APIs are encapsulated
in a set of well-designed, fully object-oriented C++ classes. It is
clear that Qt offers superior features to those found in FLTK. But
it has a downside: the license can only be considered Free for the
GNU/Linux platform.

<P>
Currently most of CLAM's XML support is given through the use of Xerces-C++.
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Xerces-C++</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-Xercesc">Xercesc, </A>] is a validating XML parser
written in a portable subset of C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give
your application the ability to read and write XML data. A shared
library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and validating
XML documents. Xerces-C++ is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation
and associated standards ( DOM 1.0, DOM 2.0. SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces,
and W3C's XML Schema recommendation version 1.0.) The parser provides
high performance, modularity, and scalability. Source code, samples
and API documentation are provided with the parser. For portability,
care has been taken to make minimal use of templates, no RTTI, no
C++ namespaces and minimal use of #ifdefs. It must be said though
that some of those decisions have produced a code that is less efficient
than desirable. For this reason other solutions for the CLAM XML support
are already under study.

<P>
In order to offer transparent audio input/audio on any platform different
solutions have been used in CLAM. As already explained in section
<A HREF="node119.html#sec:_CLAMTools">3.2.2</A> CLAM adds an abstraction layer on a number of
libraries in order to make them homogeneously accessible. These libraries
are PortAudio, RTAudio, Alsa, and DirectX Sound. The first two are
indeed cross-platform audio libraries that in CLAM are used both for
Microsoft Windows and Apple OSX while the other two are platform-specific.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Port Audio</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BencinaPortAudio">Bencina and Burk, 2001</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#BencinaPortAudio03">Bencina, 2003</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-PortAudio">www-PortAudio, </A>]
is a Free cross-platform library for managing audio input and output
on virtually any platform. It offers thorough support for all the
platforms offering low latency and high efficiency. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">RtAudio</SPAN>[<A
 HREF="node207.html#RtAudioICMC02">Scavone, 2002</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-RtAudio">www-RtAudio, </A>]
is a similar library. Although it may not offer as many features as
PortAudio, it is much easier to use and deploy as it is just made
up of a single C++ class and it is more object-oriented. On GNU/Linux
CLAM directly addresses the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ALSA</SPAN> library interface in order
to ensure low-latency and the highest efficiency. This can also be
done (up to the operating system's particular limitations) on the
Microsoft Windows platform using the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">DirectX Sound</SPAN> interface
to CLAM.

<P>
In a similar way <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">PortMIDI</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-PortMIDI">www-PortMIDI, </A>] is used for
MIDI input/output on the Microsoft Windows and Apple OSX operating
systems while the ALSA interface is directly used on GNU/Linux.

<P>
Three libraries are used for sound file input/output: Libsndfile,
LibMad and OggVorbis. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Libsndfile</SPAN> is a GPL library that gives
support to virtually any sound file format. In CLAM it is used especially
for encoding/decoding PCM audio formats. Both LibMad and OggVorbis
offer support for compressed formats not available in Libsndfile.
OggVorbis supports the Free <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Ogg</SPAN> format while LibMad supports
the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">MP3</SPAN> format, which is subject to some patent issues but
so extended that it seemed a good idea to integrate into CLAM.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Id3lib</SPAN>[<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-id3lib">www-id3lib, </A>] is a Free Software, cross-platform
software development library for reading, writing, and manipulating
ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. ID3 is a standard specification to add metadata
information (such as author or title) to any sound file.

<P>
Finally the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Win Pthreads</SPAN> library is used to ensure the use
of this standard in the Microsoft Windows operating system when handling
multi-threading issues.
