<P>

<P>
In this introduction we will define the general scope and goals of
this thesis, outlining its most important contents and setting the
basis for the conceptual framework that will be later described.

<P>
First, it is important to describe its contextual situation. The work
here presented is the result of our research in the Music Technology
Group of the Institut Universitari de l'Audiovisual at the Universitat
Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. This group focuses its research on the
analysis, processing and synthesis of audio in general and musical
signals in particular. The research area defined as Musical Technology
is very much related, though broader in its scope, to Computer Music.
The basic disciplines that are mostly related to it are Computer Science
and Signal Processing.

<P>
Nevertheless, this Thesis is not about Computer Science nor about
Signal Processing techniques. We would ascribe its content to the
area of Software Engineering. Although it may not seem obvious in
the first place, Software Engineering uses completely different approaches
from Computer Science, although it shares some of its basis. Computer
Science as a discipline is more related to abstract sciences like
Mathematics than to practical ones such as Biology. On the other hand
Software Engineering is not a science in its methodology or its approaches,
it is an engineering more related in this sense to other engineering
areas or architecture. As Herbert A. Simon puts it ``Engineering
is about synthesis and science is about analysis'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#SimonArtificial">Simon, 1996</A>].

<P>
Because of this, the formal approach in this work is somehow different
to what one would may expect in the first place. Very few mathematical
formulas are included and no experimental data results are thoroughly
analyzed. On the other hand formal modelling languages such as UML
are used throughout. Software engineering is still a fairly new discipline
and as such not many research models are available and some of them
are too much influenced by the tradition of Computer Science. With
this thesis we hope also to have contributed in this direction.

<P>
This thesis has five different parts that may be read and treated
differently. Chapter <A HREF="node6.html#ch:_FoundationalIssues">1</A> introduces the
concepts and terms that will be use throughout the following sections.
It should not only be seen as a documentation exercise but also as
a presentation of a conceptual framework that is new, maybe not in
its parts but as a whole. In chapter <A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A>
we introduce a thorough review of environments for music and audio
processing, all of them represent a different approach but are also
somehow related to both the conceptual and development frameworks
that will be presented in the next chapters. Chapter <A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A>
contains the more practical side of this work as it presents a framework
for audio and music applications we have developed and implemented
and from which the metamodel presented as the main thesis of this
work has been abstracted. Chapter <A HREF="node135.html#ch:_DSPOOM">4</A> presents the core
thesis of this work, introducing an object-oriented metamodel for
signal processing derived from the framework presented in the previous
chapter. Finally, in chapters <A HREF="node155.html#ch:_OOCTM">5</A> and <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A>,
two different and complementary extensions are given to the basic
model. The first one deals with the addition of a higher abstraction
layer and the idea of using the framework as a base for content processing.
The second one enhances the object-oriented metamodel by adapting
it to the music domain and gives some examples of implementations.

<P>
We will now try to offer a more schematic view of this thesis. This
may be used as a guide for the whole work here presented if, reading
one of the parts, it is not clear how it is related to the main thesis
or hypothesis.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Main Thesis: The object-oriented paradigm may be used to model any
signal processing system in an effective and thorough manner.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 1</SPAN>: The Object-Oriented model is not just another
model, it is the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">paradigm</SPAN> to use when modeling a system.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 1.1</SPAN>: By using the Object-Oriented paradigm to model
the signal processing domain we come up with a graphical Metamodel
of Computation that can be instantiated to model any signal processing
system. This graphical metamodel is very much related to Process Networks.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 2</SPAN>: Using this metamodel for signal processing, it
is possible to derive a new communication metamodel as an extension
of the classical Shannon and Weaver theory.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 2.1</SPAN>: The object-oriented metamodel for communication
promotes the importance of meaning and semantics in the communication
chain.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 3</SPAN>: Frameworks generate metamodels

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 3.1</SPAN>: Although traditionally the first thing to do
when implementing a framework is to come up with a domain model, using
an incremental process methoda we are able to see it the other way
around: it is the process of implementing a reusable framework that
generates the domain metamodel.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 4</SPAN>: The object-oriented paradigm is also useful for
modeling more symbolic domains like music.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Hypothesis 4.1</SPAN>: Music - and by extension any other symbolic
domain related to signal processing - is also well suited for using
the object-oriented paradigm as long as a system is properly identified,
this paradigm acting as a bridge between different abstraction levels.
The resulting music model is in fact a particular instance of the
basic object-oriented metamodel for signal processing.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
All these different thesis are also backed by practical examples that
demonstrate their viability. Out of all these examples the CLAM framework,
presented in chapter <A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A> is the most important as it sets
the basis for the general metamodel that will be later particularized,
extended or instantiated.

<P>
As a matter of fact one may ask how hypothesis are tested in a discipline
such as Software Engineering. The way hypothesis about models and
metamodels related to Software Engineering are validated is very similar
to how hypothesis are tested in experimental sciences: by empirical
testing. The only difference is that instead of analyzing resulting
data to conclude whether it fits the model under study, here we analyze
the systems derived from the metamodel to conclude whether they are
useful in the domain under study. That is why, of all the metamodels
and models here presented include a practical or empirical demonstration
of their validity. Namely:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Hypothesis: DSPOOM (see <A HREF="node135.html#ch:_DSPOOM">4</A>) -- Validation: CLAM (see
<A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A>)
</LI>
<LI>Hypothesis: OOCTM (see <A HREF="node155.html#ch:_OOCTM">5</A>) -- Validation: Several related
applications (see <A HREF="node178.html#sec:Content-based-transformations">5.3.4</A> and <A HREF="node179.html#sec:OOCTM-Sample-applications">5.4</A>)
</LI>
<LI>Hypothesis: Object-Oriented Music Model (see <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A>)
-- Validation: MetriX (see <A HREF="node186.html#sec:MetriX">6.4</A>)
