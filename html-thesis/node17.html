Systems
</H2>

<P>
The definition of system given the Institute of Electrical and Electronical
Engineers professional group in System Science and Cybernetics (from
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#RoweSystemCybernetics">Rowe, 1965</A>]): ``a large collection of interacting
functional units that together achieve a defined purpose''. Or, in
other words, a system is made up of three main components: a goal,
a set of things and/or rules, and the way this things and/or rules
are organized or connected in between them. There is a whole corpus
of System Engineering but systems are also studied from a psychological
or even philosophical point of view.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#DeGreeneSystemsPsychology">DeGreene, 1970</A>], the author defends that systems
are studied to: improve the system or its successor, determine general
theories for new system development, and advance science. He also
mentions that there are several scientific methods related to systems
such as generalization across systems, analysis and synthesis, and
modeling and simulation. All of these methods are of course interrelated.
When analyzing a system, the basic steps are: (1) recognition that
a problem exists and the solution may be related to systems analysis
techniques; (2) definition of the problem in a appropriate form; (3)
definition of the system itself (iterative process that starts with
a gross approximation and results in a conceptual model); (4) definition
of performance criteria; (5) definition of alternative configurations
and their evaluation; (6) presentation of alternatives and tradeoff
results to the user; (7) performance of iterative analysis during
development; (9) analysis of operational systems to gather performance
data [<A
 HREF="node207.html#DeGreeneSystemsPsychology">DeGreene, 1970</A>].

<P>
But one of the most commonly accepted definitions for ``system''
is surprisingly related to the software engineering corpus. In the
article entitled ``Definition of System'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#HallFagenDefinitionOfSystem">Hall and Fagen, 1956</A>]
the authors define: ``A system is a set of objects together with
relationships between the objects and between their attributes.''
This definition, that is largely referenced and commented in the literature
about system theory, was made in 1956, much before the term object
orientation was even coined. So, according to Hall and Fagen, objects
are simply the parts, or components of a system. 

<P>
Attributes are the properties of objects. Relationships tie the system
components together. A system cannot be considered as such if it does
not have a purpose in itself. This assertion also implies that a system
has properties, functions or purposes distinct from its constituent
objects, relationships and attributes. Objects can be physical parts
or abstract objects such as variables or equations. The relationships
are those that tie the system together. The question of whether a
relationship is important or trivial depends on the problem to be
solved. And another interesting property of any system is that can
be subdivided hierarchically into subsystems, sub-subsystems, components,
units, parts and so forth. Any of this levels can be considered to
be made up of objects as either a subsystem, component, unit or part
is an object in itself.

<P>
If we accept Hall and Fagen's definition as approximately valid (note
that the definition of system given by the IEEE is not conceptually
very different) we can assert that the object-oriented paradigm is
the best alternative when modeling a system. A system is in fact made
of objects that relate in between them, we just have to identify them.

<P>
According to [<A
 HREF="node207.html#DeGreeneSystemsPsychology">DeGreene, 1970</A>] different features
characterize any system analysis: (1) emphasis on an uncertain future;
(2) tendency to oversimplify; (3) evaluation of alternatives; (4)
aid to conceptualization; (5) decline pressures resisting analysis;
(6) use mutually reinforcing techniques; and (7) selection of relevant
variables. System analysis have a qualitative beginning, quantification
becomes possible as greater detail and precision is introduced. As
a matter of fact, and according to [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BouldingGeneralSystemTheory">Boulding, 1969</A>],
one possible approach to general systems theory is through the arrangement
of theoretical systems and constructs in a hierarchy of complexity.
In any case, and as we will see in next section, this is usually accomplished
through the use of appropriate <SPAN  CLASS="textit">models</SPAN>.

<P>
The state of a system is the collection of variables necessary to
describe a system at a given time. An event is an instantaneous occurrence
that may change the state of the system. In general, systems are classified
as discrete or continuous (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#LawSimulationModelling">Law and Kelton, 2000</A>]). A
discrete system is one for which the state variables change instantaneously
at separated points of time. In a continuous system these variables
change continuously. Some systems are neither completely discrete
nor completely continuous: combined discrete-continuous simulation.
There are three types of interactions between discrete and continuous
variables:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A discrete event may change the value of a continuous variable
</LI>
<LI>A discrete event may cause the relationship governing a continuous
state variable to change at a particular time.
</LI>
<LI>A continuous state variable achieving a threshold may cause a discrete
event to occur or to be scheduled.
</LI>
</UL>
