Common Music 
</H2>

<P>
Common Music [<A
 HREF="node207.html#TaubeCommonMusic90">Taube, 1990</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#TaubeCommonMusic98">Taube, 1998</A>] is an object-oriented
musical composition interface that bases its results in the definition
of classes and objects that interact between them at the program level.
CM is Free and it is updated regularly.

<P>
Common Music treats the composition process as an experimental process
aimed at describing the sound and its higher-level structure. It has
a number of composition tools as well as a public interface. It can
be used in conjunction with many different existing protocols and
languages such as MIDI, CSound, Common Lisp Music or Music Kit. 

<P>
Common Music is implemented in Common Lisp and CLOS and runs on different
platforms including PC, Macintosh, SGI, NeXT and SUN. Source code
is publicly available.

<P>
Common Music structure is based on the separation of three different
levels in the music composition process. On one level, the composer
concentrates on developing musical ideas. On another level, the composer
worries about how these ideas can be translated to the real world.
An on the last level, the musician must understand how the composer's
ideas have to be conceived. This separation allows the re-use of common
higher level structures.

<P>
Common Music provides three different interaction modes that can act
in parallel. The most basic way to interact with the system is through
the program Lisp source code. This mode of interaction offers much
flexibility to control algorithms but ignores many of the system utilities.
The second mode implies working through the command interpreter, which
translates text messages into system actions. The command interpreter
in Common Music is called Stella. The main advantage of this mode
is that it allows for flexible edition but, on the downside, the creation
of complex commands results into very complex messages. And finally,
the third interaction mode is through the use of a graphical interface
called Capella that is only available for the Macintosh platform.

<P>
Common Music defines six kinds of collections, which can be specialized
or enhanced by the user. The existing collections are: <TT>Thread</TT>,
<TT>Merge</TT>, <TT>Heap</TT>, <TT>Algorithm</TT>, <TT>Network</TT>,
and <TT>Layout</TT>. A <TT>Thread</TT> represents a line of events
to be sequentially processed. A <TT>Merge</TT> represents parallel
or multiple temporal command lines. A <TT>Heap</TT> is a collection
that represents a random grouping that is converted into a temporal
line after mixing its substructure and then processing it sequentially
like a <TT>Thread</TT>. An <TT>Algorithm</TT> represents a program
description, that is the temporal line of events is produced by calling
a user-specified program. A <TT>Network</TT> is a collection that
represents a user-defined order, the temporal line of events is produced
by the call to a condition that can be expressed through a pattern
or a function. Finally, a <TT>Layout</TT> refers to arbitrary chunks
of an existing structure.

<P>
The act of translating the high-level information introduced by the
user into a lower-level information understandable by the synthesizer
is known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">realization</SPAN>. This realization can happen at different
levels and through two working modes: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">run-time</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">real-time</SPAN>.
In the first mode, events receive a time tag but the clock advances
as fast as it can. In the second mode the time tag is exactly that
of the real time.

<P>
In Common Music, the final result depends both in the events and in
the context. This context is known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stream</SPAN> and can include
outputs such as Postscript or sound files or MIDI ports. All these
different streams are controlled by the protocol that is in charge
of taking the right actions depending on the current combination of
events and stream.

<P>
Common Music has different procedures and classes that are designed
to give support to the musical composition process. These tools include
high-level macros to create musical structures, musical data representation
or envelopes. The user can combine these functions with the functionality
included in the Common Lisp programming language.
