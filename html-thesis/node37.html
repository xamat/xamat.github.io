Kahn Process Networks
</H3>

<P>
Process Networks is a Model of Computation (MoC) that was originally
developed for modeling distributed systems but has proven its convenience
for modeling signal processing systems. Process Networks are also
called Kahn Process Networks after G. Kahn who first introduced them
in his thesis (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#KahnProcessNetworks">Kahn, 1974</A>]). It is a natural model
for describing signal processing systems where infinite streams of
data are incrementally transformed by processes executing in sequence
or parallel. Nevertheless, and as pointed out by [<A
 HREF="node207.html#LeeAndTomasDataflowNetworks">Lee and Park, 1995</A>],
this model of computation does not require multitasking or parallelism
and usually neither infinite queues; it is in fact usually more efficient
than comparable methods in functional languages. Process Networks
have found many applications in modeling embedded systems as it is
typical for embedded systems to be designed to operate infinitely
with limited resources.

Commercial systems like SPW from Alta Group of Cadence, COSSAP from
Synopsys, the DSP Station from Mentor Graphics, Hypersignal from Hyperception
or Simulink by Mathworks and research software like Khoros from the
University of New Mexico and Ptolemy from the Univ. of California
at Berkeley are all based on variants of the Process Network model.
Departing from the original Process Networks by Kahn, a number of
more specific models have been derived. In this section we will give
an introduction to the basic Kahn's Process Networks and will leave
the more specific models for next sections.

<P>
Process Networks are directed graphs where nodes represent <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processes</SPAN>
and arcs are infinite FIFO queues that connect these processes (see
figure <A HREF="#fig:A-Kahn-Process">1.4</A>). Writing to a channel is non blocking
(it always succeeds immediately) but reading is blocking. If a process
tries to read from an empty input it is suspended until it has enough
input data and the execution context is switched to another process
or level. A process may not ``test'' channel for presence of data.
At any given point a process is either ``enabled'' or ``blocked''
waiting for data on one of its channels. It can not be waiting for
data on one or another input channel.

<P>
In Kahn Process Networks processes produce tokens (data elements)
that are sent along a communication channel and consumed by the destination
process. Communication channels are the only way processes may exchange
information. KPN systems are determinate: the history of tokens produced/consumed
does not depend on execution order. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stream</SPAN> is a finite or
infinite sequence of data elements or tokens X=[x1,x2...] where
xi is a particular token. A process is in this sense a functional
mapping from input to output streams.

<P>
As pointed out by [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ParksProcessNetworksPhD">Parks, 1995</A>] a parallelism can
be made with Turing Machines: a Process Network can be seen as a set
of Turing machines connected with one-way tapes, each machine operating
on its own tape. Because of the ``halting problem'' we cannot
tell in a finite time whether an arbitrary Turing machine program
will halt, and the same is true for Process Networks. Two properties
of Process Networks are related to this problem: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">termination</SPAN>
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">boundness</SPAN>. These properties are undecidable in finite time
for the general case but, under some restrictions, we can study and
classify PN before execution.

<P>
According to [<A
 HREF="node207.html#WebbProcessNetworks">Webb et&nbsp;al., 1999</A>] interesting properties of
process networks that make them a suitable model for computation are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Each process is a sequential program that consumes tokens from its
inputs queues and produces tokens to the output queues.
</LI>
<LI>Each queue has one source and one destination.
</LI>
<LI>The network has no global data
</LI>
<LI>Each process is blocked when it tries to read from a a channel with
insufficient data. The process resumes when there is enough data again.
</LI>
<LI>Although writing is generally non-blocking, blocking can be used to
be able to use bounded queues.
</LI>
<LI>Concurrency can be implemented safely.
</LI>
<LI>Scheduling is transparent to the user
</LI>
<LI>Hierarchy or scalability.
</LI>
</UL>
