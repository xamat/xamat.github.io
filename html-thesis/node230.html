Spectral Processing
</H1>

<P>
Although this subsection may seem a bit off-topic, there are several
reasons for its inclusion. First, many of the applications that are
mentioned in different chapters are related to spectral processing
techniques; second, the CLAM framework was born when the research
group was basically involved in research into spectral domain and
that definitely biased and conditioned many of the design decisions;
and last, much work of the author (see <A HREF="node232.html#ch:_MyPublications">C</A>)
is directly related with spectral modeling and is not reflected anywhere
else in this Thesis. 

<P>
The most common approach for converting a time domain signal into
its frequency domain representation is the Short-Time Fourier Transform
(STFT). It is a general technique from which we can implement loss-less
analysis/synthesis systems. Many sound transformation systems are
based on direct implementations of the basic algorithm and several
examples have been presented in chapter 8. 

<P>
In this chapter, we will briefly mention the Sinusoidal Model and
will concentrate, with a Matlab sample code, in the Sinusoidal plus
Residual Model. Anyhow, the decision as to what spectral representation
to use in a particular situation is not an easy one. The boundaries
are not clear and there are always compromises to take into account,
such as: (1) sound fidelity, (2) flexibility, (3) coding efficiency,
and (4) computational requirements. Ideally, we want to maximize fidelity
and flexibility while minimizing memory consumption and computational
requirements. The best choice for maximum fidelity and minimum compute
time is the STFT that, anyhow, yields a rather inflexible representation
and inefficient coding scheme. Thus our interest in finding higher-level
representations as the ones we present in this section.

<P>
Using the output of the STFT, the Sinusoidal model represents a step
towards a more flexible representations while compromising both sound
fidelity and computing time. It is based on modeling the time-varying
spectral characteristics of a sound as sums of time-varying sinusoids.
To obtain a sinusoidal representation from a sound, an analysis is
performed in order to estimate the instantaneous amplitudes and phases
of the sinusoids. This estimation is generally done by first computing
the STFT of the sound, then detecting the spectral peaks (and measuring
the magnitude, frequency and phase of each one), and finally organizing
them as time-varying sinusoidal tracks.

<P>
It is a quite general technique that can be used in a wide range of
sounds and offers a gain in flexibility compared with the direct STFT
implementation.
