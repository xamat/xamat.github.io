<H4><A NAME="SECTION00422210000000000000">
Dynamic Types</A>
</H4>

<P>
Though it might be a quite controversial issue and its name may after
this explanation seem not the most appropriate<A NAME="tex2html22"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5593"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>, there are three main reasons for the decision of implementing and
using Dynamic Types (DTs for short) in CLAM.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>There is a need in some core classes of the library, of working with
classes with a large number of attributes, i.e.: the descriptors of
audio segments, where in most cases only a small subset is needed.
In this sense it could represent a waste of space if memory is always
allocated for all attributes. DT can instantiate and de-instantiate
attributes at run-time, and do it in such a way that its interface
is the same as if they where normal C++ attributes. 
</LI>
<LI>We want support for working with hierarchic or tree structures. That
means not only composition of DTs but also aggregates of them (lists,
vectors, etc. of DTs). With such compositions of DTs, we can use assignation,
and two clone member functions: <TT>ShallowCopy()</TT> and <TT>DeepCopy()</TT>,
the good thing is that they come free; we don't need to write these
members in none of the DT concrete classes. 
</LI>
<LI>We need introspection of each DT object. That is the ability to know
the name and type of each dynamic attribute, to iterate through theses
attributes, and to have some type specific handlers for each. One
clear application of introspection is storage support for loading
from, and storing to a file, of a tree of DTs. Of course all this
is implemented generically, so it appears transparent to the user.
XML support, for instance, is implemented. Other profits we take from
introspection in DT are debugging aids. 
</LI>
</OL>
All Processing Data classes in CLAM are DT, as well as the configuration
classes for both Processings and Processings Data.

<P>
For instantiating and de-instantiating dynamic attributes the developer
declaring a Dynamic Type class has to use a set of macros that then,
on pre-compile time, expand all of the functionality.

<P>
We will describe how Dynamic Type classes work and how they can be
used through an example. Imagine we want to model a musical note with
a DT<A NAME="tex2html23"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1944"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A>. We declare the DT class like this:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="149" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img18.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize class Note : public DynamicType}{\foo...
...esize\par
}
\par
\textsf{\footnotesize\};}\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
As it can be seen, three different macros are used in Dynamic Types:
<TT>DYNAMIC_TYPE</TT> for expanding the concrete DT constructors,
<TT>DYN_ATTRIBUTE</TT> for declaring each dynamic attribute and <TT>DYN_CONTAINER_ATTRIBUTE</TT>
for declaring any STL interface compliant container.

<P>
1. <TT>DYNAMIC_TYPE</TT> is a macro that expands the default constructor
of the concrete DT being declared. The first parameter is the total
number of dynamic attributes, and the second one the class name. If
the writer of a DT derived class sees the need of writing a customized
default constructor or other constructors it can be done using special
purpose initializers. english

<P>
2. <TT>DYN_ATTRIBUTE</TT> is used to declare a dynamic attribute.
It has four parameters, the first one is the attribute order (needed
for technical reasons of the DT implementation), the second one is
the accessibility (public, protected or private) the third one is
the type: it can be any C++ valid type including typedef definitions
but not references or pointers. englishThe forth
and last parameter is the attribute name, it is important to begin
in upper-case because this name (let's call it XXX) will be used to
form the attribute accessors <TT>GetXXX()</TT> and <TT>SetXXX()</TT>,
thus the XXX must start in upper-case.

<P>
3. <TT>DYN_CONTAINER_ATTR</TT>: The purpose of this one is to give
storage (only XML by now) support to attributes declared as containers
of objects. For that, we need that container to fulfill the STL container
interface, so all the STL collection of containers is usable. This
macro has five parameters, one more that <TT>DYN_ATTRIBUTE</TT>:
the attribute numeration, accessibility, the type, the name of the
attribute and finally the new one: the label of each contained element
that will be stored.
<BR>
Returning to the example above, each <TT>DYN_ATTRIBUTE</TT> macro
will expand a set of usable methods:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="312" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize float\&amp; GetPitch(), void SetPitch(con...
...h(Storage\&amp;), bool LoadPitch(Storage\&amp;);
}\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
Of course <TT>GetPitch</TT> and <TT>SetPitch</TT> are the usual accessors
to the data. <TT>AddPitch</TT> and <TT>RemovePitch</TT> will
instantiate and de-instantiate the attribute, combined with <TT>UpdateData</TT>
that will be explained latter on. <TT>HasPitch</TT> returns whether
Pitch is instantiate at this moment. Finally <TT>StorePitch</TT> and
<TT>LoadPitch</TT> are for storage purposes.

<P>
Once, the concrete DT Note has been declared, we can use it like this:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="462" HEIGHT="39" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize Note myNote; // create an instance of...
...); myNote.AddNSines(); myNote.AddSines();}\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
Or in the case that we want all of them, is better to use <TT>AddAll</TT>.
This method is not macro generated as <TT>AddPitch</TT>, but is available
in any concrete DT.
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf"><SMALL CLASS="FOOTNOTESIZE">myNote.AddAll();</SMALL></SPAN>
<BR>
<P>


<P>
As this kind of operations requires memory management we want to update
the data, with its possible reallocations only once for every modification
of the DT shape or structure (what can mean lots of individual adds
and removes). We'll use the DynamicType member UpdateData for that
purpose:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize std::cout &lt; {}&lt; myNote.HasPitch()
//...
...&lt; myNote.HasPitch()
// writes out: 'true'}\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
And now all the instantiated attributes can be used normally using
the accessors <TT>GetXXX</TT> and <TT>SetXXX</TT>. For example:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="119" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize myNote.SetNSines(10);}{\footnotesize\...
...otesize int j=myNote.GetNSines();&nbsp; // ok.}\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>
