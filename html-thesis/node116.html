Processing Data</A>
</H4>

<P>
Therefore, one of the main traits of CLAM is the ability to process
multiple data types related to the audio and music domain. All these
data types are subclasses of the ProcessingData class. <SPAN ID="hue2049"></SPAN>In
CLAM terminology, a Processing Data class is a class designed for
storing all sort of data that will be used in the processing system.
All Processing objects are input Processing Data objects (either through
Ports when connected in a Network or as arguments of the non-network
<TT>Do()</TT> operation). Examples of already provided Processing
Data classes include <TT>Spectrum</TT>, <TT>Audio</TT>, <TT>SpectralPeakArray</TT>,
<TT>Fundamental</TT>, <TT>Segment</TT>, or <TT>Frame</TT> (see section
<A HREF="node102.html#sec:_CLAMDataRepository">3.2.1</A>).

<P>
Any PD class is in fact a concrete Dynamic Type class therefore and
as just explained most of their attributes are macro-derived dynamic
attributes (i.e. in the code you will see something like <TT>DYN_ATTRIBUTE(1,public,
Spectrum, ResidualSpectrum)</TT>, which means that the given class
has a public dynamic attribute called <TT>ResidualSpectrum</TT> that
is an object of the <TT>Spectrum</TT> class).

<P>
All dynamic attributes have associated automatically derived Setters
and Getters that may be used from outside the class. Furthermore,
they can be Added and Removed at run-time as explained in the previous
paragraphs.

<P>
Some classes have private dynamic attributes that cannot be accessed
directly but through a given public interface. If you encounter a
private or protected attribute with a name starting with the 'pr'
prefix (i.e. <TT>prSize</TT>) you should look for its associated public
interface (i.e. <TT>GetSize()</TT> and <TT>SetSize()</TT>). Also very
rarely, some PD class have an attribute that is not dynamic. In that
case, the corresponding Set/Get interface should be offered so its
usage is not different than that <TT>of a Dynamic Attribute</TT>.

<P>
Most PD classes offer convenient shortcuts for accessing and setting
elements in their buffers that should be very useful in a developing
stage but should be avoided if seeking efficiency in a given algorithm.

<P>
A data storage class derives publicly from ProcessingData. Thus, it
is a concrete Dynamic Type class and must use the <TT>DYNAMIC_TYPE_USING_INTERFACE</TT>
macro.
<BR>
<P>
Ex:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="155" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img23.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\textsf{\footnotesize class SpectralPeak: public Processing...
...notesize&nbsp; (.)}\\
\textsf{\footnotesize }\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
Apart from the default constructor (already available as a result
of the Dynamic Type macros), other constructors may be implemented.
All these constructors must call the constructor of the <TT>ProcessingData</TT>
base class using the member initialization syntax and passing the
number of Dynamic Attributes as parameter. Apart from that, these
constructors must call a macro-derived method called <TT>MandatoryInit()</TT>,
which is in charge of initializing concrete Dynamic Type's internal
structure.

<P>
Another initializer that is often useful is the <TT>DefaultInit()</TT>
method. This method has to be implemented by the developer and is
in charge of initializing default attributes and values. This method
is automatically called from the Processing Data's default constructor
and may also be called from all other constructors.

<P>
The most usual non-default constructors that a Processing Data class
is bound to have are the Copy constructor and the Configuration constructor.
The former is already implemented in the <TT>ProcessingData</TT> base
class and this implementation is sufficient as long as all attributes
of the concrete class are Dynamic and require no initialization. If
not (for example if the class has a non Dynamic member), the developer
may make use of the <TT>CopyInit()</TT> method. This method has to
be implemented by hand, but is automatically called from the macro
derived Copy constructor.

<P>
The configuration constructor is sometimes desirable for constructing
a Processing Data out of its associated configuration object or out
of some sort of initial value (flags, size.). In this case the constructor
must explicitly call the <TT>MandatoryInit()</TT> method and then
call any other necessary configuration methods.
