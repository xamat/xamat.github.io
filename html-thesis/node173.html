Other Models of Communication that care about Meaning</A>
</H3>

<P>
Although the Shannon and Weaver theory has deeply influenced all research
areas related with communication and we have presented our metamodel
as a step beyond that observes the importance of meaning, it is important
to note that some models of human communication do care about meaning
and make a central issue of it. It is well beyond our intention to
give a thorough overview of such models, mostly related to psychological
or sociological arenas but it is interesting to include a brief outline
in which we will find some relation with the metamodel we have just
presented.

<P>
Charles Osgood is the creator of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Meditacional Theory of
Meaning [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OswoodMeasuringMeaning">Oswood, 1976</A>]</SPAN>, related to his well known
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">semantic differential</SPAN> technique [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OswoodSemanticDifferential">Snyder and Oswood, 1967</A>].
According to the results of his studies the meaning of any piece of
information can be described in terms of only three dimensions: its
evaluation (whether it is good or bad), potency (how strong it is)
and activity (how fast it moves).

<P>
Pierce and Cronen developed a model of communication that strongly
relies on meaning. This model is known as the Coordinated Management
of Meaning (CMM) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#CMM">Philipsen, 1995</A>] and its main feature is that instead
of focusing on the message, the stress is put on the receiver. People
try to understand the world assigning meaning to an event, the problem
is that individual interpretations may not coincide. The CMM represents
meaning in a six level map that goes from the actual <SPAN  CLASS="textit">content</SPAN>
to the highest level of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cultural patterns</SPAN>.

<P>
In a similar way the General Semantics Theory[<A
 HREF="node207.html#GeneralSemantics">Kodish, 1993</A>]
states that you cannot equate a word with the concept that it's supposed
to represent. Hayakawa proposes an 'Abstraction Ladder', the actual
content can be decomposed into different representations according
on the level of abstraction intended. The problem is that as we go
higher on the ladder, there is a point where 'speakers' lose the picture
of the actual content. He gives the example of an Abstraction Ladder
for a picture of a cow. This ladder includes the following levels:
(1) Cow as known to science; (2) the actual cow we perceive; (3) &#34;Bessie&#34;
(the cow's name); (4) Cow; (5) Livestock; (6) Farm assets; (7) Asset;
(8) Wealth. This abstraction ladder is directly related to the multilevel
analysis and content description scheme we presented in section <A HREF="node160.html#sub:The-Semantic-Transmitter">5.2.1</A>.

<P>
I.A. Richard developed a theory on the ``Meaning of Meaning''
in which he suggested that context is key to meaning [<A
 HREF="node207.html#RichardsMeaningOfMeaning">Ogden and Richards, 1946</A>].
Meaning is personal and in his view of the communication act he extended
Shannon and Weaver's traditional model to show the necessity of common
experience for the effective transmission of meaning. This idea is
also related to the different strategies presented for our Semantic
Receiver, outlined in section <A HREF="node165.html#sub:The-Semantic-Receiver">5.2.2</A>. 

<P>
Symbolic Interactionists, represented by George Herbert Mead, state
that the extent of knowing is the extent of naming: intelligence is
the ability to symbolically label everything we encounter [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MeadMeaning">Mead, 1910</A>].

<P>
Harold Lasswell [<A
 HREF="node207.html#CherryHumanCommunication">Cherry, 1957</A>] suggested a simple
but useful model, which captures the essence of message transmission
and is made of the following elements: Who, says What, to Whom, in
Which medium, with what Effect.

<P>
Finally it is also important to acknowledge that also some other researchers
in the audio processing field noted that S&amp;W's disregard for meaning
imposed too many restrictions on our domain. In particular, the developers
of the Structured Audio metamodel, which will be presented in next
section, also presented their model as a step beyond S&amp;W's.
