The Object-Oriented Content Transmission Metamodel 
</H1>

<P>
The basic DSPOOM metamodel has proven to be useful for modeling DSP
processes and applications. The present chapter is concerned with
the applicability of the metamodel to more abstract processes that
are related to the DSP domain but also to higher-level semantic domains.
It turns out that this new metamodel, instance of the basic DSPOOM,
fits well to the idea of Content Transmission. We introduced the idea
of Content Transmission in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatContentTransmissionDAFX">Amatriain and Herrera, 2001a</A>] and
later developed it in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatAES">Amatriain and Herrera, 2001b</A>], where the Object-oriented
Content Transmission Metamodel (OOCTM) was first presented as such.
In the present chapter we will highlight its main features.

<P>
As audio and music processing applications tend to increase their
level of abstraction and to approach the end-user level it seems clear
that one of the focuses is to step up from the signal processing realm
and directly address the content level of an audio source. The term
content-processing is therefore becoming commonly accepted [<A
 HREF="node207.html#CamurriMusicContentProcessing">Camurri, 1999</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#ChiariglioneValueContent">Chiariglione, 2000</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#KarjalainenImmersionAndContent">Karjalainen, 1999</A>].
Content processing is a general term that includes applications such
as content analysis, content-based transformations or content-based
retrieval. 

<P>
While manual annotation has been used for many years in different
applications, the focus now is on finding automatic content extraction
and content processing tools. An increasing number of projects focus
on the extraction of meaningful features from an audio signal. Meanwhile,
standards like MPEG7 [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7Overview">Mart&#237;nez, 2002</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7Book">Manjunath et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>] are trying to
find a convenient way of describing audiovisual content. Nevertheless,
content description is usually thought of as an additional information
stream attached to the actual content and the only envisioned scenario
is that of a search and retrieval framework.

<P>
The basic idea when implementing a content processing scheme is to
have a previous analysis step in which the content of the signal is
identified and described. Then this description can be classified,
transmitted, or transformed. Content description is usually thought
of as an additional stream of information to be attached to the actual
content. However, if we are able to find a thorough and reliable description
we can think of forgetting about the signal and concentrate on processing
only its description. And, as it will later be discussed, the goal
of finding an appropriate content description is very much related
to the task of identifying and describing the so-called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Sound
Objects</SPAN>.

<P>
Bearing these previous ideas in mind, a metamodel of content transmission
(see Figure <A HREF="#fig:OOCTM_diagram">5.1</A>) is proposed as a general framework
for content-based applications. As we will later see any content-based
application can be modeled as a subset of this metamodel.

</DIV>

<P>
The metamodel is based on an analysis-synthesis process. Therefore,
the only data involved in the transmission step is the content description
taking the form of metadata. A multilevel content description tree
is used as an efficient representation of the identified Sound Object
hierarchy. Several technologies are available for representing content
description, but, taking into account our experience in MPEG-7s standardization
process [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7TimbreCE">Petters et&nbsp;al., 1999</A>], we would in a general situation recommend
an XML-based metadata language such as MPEG-7s DDL.

<P>
A property derived from our OOCTM is that if there is a suitable content
description, the actual content itself may no longer be needed and
we can concentrate on transmitting only its description. Thus, the
receiver should be able to interpret the information that, in the
form of metadata, is available at its inputs, and synthesize new content
relying only on this description. It is possibly in the music field
where this last step has been further developed, and that fact allows
us to think of such a transmission scheme being available on the near
future.

<P>
The OOCTM does not worry about encoding fidelity or signal distortion
in the classical sense. A signal has been correctly encoded and transmitted
if its meaning has not changed substantially. And what ``substantially''
means depends on the particular application: in some applications
we may need to keep signal-level fidelity while in others we may just
be interested in the approximate content in abstract terms.

<P>
Audio representations can be classified according to the following
properties [<A
 HREF="node207.html#VercoeStructuredAudio">Vercoe et&nbsp;al., 1998</A>]: encodability, synthesizability,
generecity, meaningfulness, accuracy, efficiency and compactness.
A representation is said to be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encodable</SPAN> if it can be directly
derived from the waveform. On the other hand it is said to be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">synthesizable</SPAN>
if an ``appropriate'' sound can be obtained from the representation.
A description that is both encodable and synthesizable is said to
be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">invertible</SPAN><A NAME="tex2html59"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5660"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>. 

<P>
The more <SPAN  CLASS="textit">general</SPAN> a representation is the more kind of sounds
it will be applicable to. Sound representations that are highly semantic
(or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">meaningful</SPAN>) use parameters with clear high-level meaning
and are easier to manipulate. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Accuracy</SPAN> is a measure of how
perceptually similar the synthesized sound is to the original one
while <SPAN  CLASS="textit">efficiency</SPAN> is a measure of how far redundancy can be
exploited in a given representation. Finally, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">compactness</SPAN>
is just the ratio between accuracy and redundancy and it is a measure
of how redundancy can be exploited while maintaining a certain level
of accuracy.

<P>
Throughout this chapter we will use the word ``descriptor'' very
often. Although this concept has already been brought up in different
parts of the Thesis it is interesting to reproduce again its definition.
We will use the one given in the MPEG-7 standard where a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">descriptor</SPAN>
is defined as ``a representation of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">feature</SPAN> that defines
its syntax and semantics''. And a feature is defined as a ``a
distinctive characteristic of the data which signifies something to
somebody''.

<P>
The OOCTM is related to some existing models and metamodels. It is
interesting to note that such a transmission model can be seen as
a step beyond Shannon and Weavers traditional communication model
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#ShannonWeaver">Shannon and Weaver, 1949</A>]. We will further discuss this issue in section
<A HREF="node170.html#sub:Beyond-Shannon_SPMamp_Weaver_s-Model">5.3.1</A>. The metamodel is also quite
related to Structured Audio, a metamodel for audio and music transmission
included in the MPEG-4 standard [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerStructuredAudioMultimediaSystems">Scheirer, 1999c</A>].
We will comment and exploit this relation in section <A HREF="node174.html#sec:Structured-Audio">5.3.2</A>.

<P>
In the next sections, we will particularize this metamodel to the
case of audio and music content transmission and will give some details
on each of the components functionality.
