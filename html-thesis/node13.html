Why Objects anyway?
</H2>

<P>
Up until this point basic concepts and a possible methodology have
been defined but it is still not clear why a system designer would
want to bother using the Object Oriented approach instead of relying
on other paradigms like formal, structured, logical or functional
programming. It is specially important to answer this question in
the context of this thesis where an Object Oriented model is being
proposed as a general framework.

<P>
A lot has been written about the benefits of Object Orientation and
the reasons why nowadays has become so popular. This is a brief list
that tries to illustrate the main advantages usually attributed to
OO.

<P>
Objects map more directly to real world concepts. As it will be later
discussed, although the world is not made of objects, the object-oriented
paradigm is the most suitable way to understand systems that reside
in it. Objects are suited to model concepts related to whatever domain
under analysis and these objects are closer to the actual software
solution. Therefore, object- orientation bridges the gap between the
problem space and the solution. It also brings common terminology
between developers and domain stakeholders.

<P>
Objects enhance <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encapsulation</SPAN>. Every class encapsulates a concept.
By defining a class we separate between state and behavior: attributes
and their values represent the object state while the operations in
a class define the behavior of that family of objects. According to
the encapsulation principle, attributes should not be accessible from
outside the class. Internal state can only be modified by an object
responding to a message. Published operations represent the object
accessible behavior, but objects can also have non-accessible private
behavior.

<P>
Objects improve <SPAN  CLASS="textit">information hiding</SPAN>. Encapsulation is in fact
the first step towards a more restrictive and stronger form of structuring
object-oriented systems: information hiding. In an object-oriented
system we may choose not to publish some information for different
reasons such as limiting the system complexity and make it more understandable
or ensuring system integrity. We may choose to hide private behavior
or operations but even more, we may decide to hide all methods or
implementation details and just publish an interface for some classes.
This interface may be enough for using the whole system functionality
while not becoming overwhelmed by its internal details.

<P>
Objects promote good structuring. Software systems resulting from
object-oriented analysis and design are better structured. Both encapsulation
and information hiding, as already commented, enhance good structuring. 

<P>
Objects favor re-use. All the above properties make object-oriented
systems more reusable, not only in what code respects but also conceptually.

<P>
It is interesting to note that although all the benefits of object-orientation
are better understood when following a complete object-oriented development
process, it is also useful to use some of the OO techniques to just
some parts of the process. In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MeequelFromModelsToFrameworks">Meequel et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>]
they explain an approach in which object-oriented analysis techniques
are used although the resulting code is not programmed in an object-oriented
language due to platform restrictions (embedded software).
