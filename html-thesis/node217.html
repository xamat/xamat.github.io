<P>
Another change related with the Processing infrastructure <A HREF="node111.html#sec:_ProcessingInfrastructure">3.2.2</A>
is the clarification of a single way of doing things, removing accessory
behavior that has not proven as useful as expected. In the first phases
of the framework design, there were obvious problems of ``over-design'',
which resulted in offering different ways of doing similar things.
This flexibility promotes misuse and unnecessary complexity. There
are now many Processing classes and in some cases some of them do
similar things such as type checking or default initialization in
different ways. A clear guideline in how all Processing objects should
behave has been issued but now needs to be promoted into the whole
repository.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Cleaning up and clarifying of Processing interface. The goal is to
remove all unnecessary interface and enforce the strict use of some
design principles for all CLAM users developing their own Processing
class.
</LI>
<LI>Cleaning up duplicated, old fashioned or unused code around CLAM and
CLAM examples.
</LI>
<LI>Testing has been already introduced in the framework and is spreading
at a steady state. Both unit tests and functional tests are compiled
and run on a daily basis and help ensure the framework stability and
confidence. Nevertheless, a lot has to be done in order to have a
well-covered framework. The goal is to extend the test coverage to
most of the CLAM code, and enhancing the test infrastructure in order
to be easier for the processing writers to do their own testing.
