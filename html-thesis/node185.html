Songs and scores
</H1>

<P>
From the previous definition of note it is derived that a Song is
defined as the state chart of all Notes present in a musical system
(in the case of the conceptually equivalent model of Notes being born
and dying on receiving the start/stop message this would rather correspond
to the state chart of all the Generators). This definition is very
different from its classical equivalent in which a song or musical
piece is directly related to its score.

<P>
In the object-oriented music model here presented a musical Score
must be understood as the sequence of events or messages that will
be sent to the different objects present in the musical system. These
events, as we already illustrated in figure <A HREF="node183.html#fig:Performer-instrument-event">6.2</A>,
are the result of a supposed interaction between a Performer and an
Instrument. As a matter of fact, an event can be sent to a musical
Instrument or directly to any of its Generators and as a result it
modifies its internal state.

<P>
Two different kind of events can be distinguished. Note events are
those that through an Instrument or a Generator modify a Note as defined
in the previous section. And Global Control Events are those that
modify the whole musical system setting parameters such as tempo or
key. 

<P>
A Note Event is made of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Time Statement</SPAN> that specifies when
the event is to occur, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Variable</SPAN> that indicates what object
(Instrument, Generator...) will receive the event, and any number
of pairs Parameter/Parameter Value, where a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Parameter</SPAN> specifies
what attribute of the object will be modified, and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Parameter
Value</SPAN> contains the new value for the given parameter.

<P>
Note that, as illustrated in figure <A HREF="#cap:Score-Class-Diagram">6.7</A>,
Note Events are in fact also objects. This fact makes our model somehow
similar in this sense to the event-oriented models such as Siren (see
section <A HREF="node73.html#sub:MODE-and-Siren">2.4</A>) from which we have from the very
beginning established a clear difference. We also acknowledge the
fact that a purely object-oriented model is not incompatible with
event-driven behavior. This same conclusion was drawn by the authors
of Kyma when they added an event language in version 4.5 (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScalettiKyma2002">Scaletti, 2002</A>]).

An example of a score in pseudo-code would therefore be:

<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img83.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\texttt{\footnotesize At time=0 Note.start at InstrumentX.G...
...ize\par
}
\par
\texttt{\footnotesize At time=2 Tempo(120)}\\
\par
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
The first line is a note event that indicates that Note at GeneratorN
in InstrumentX should start sounding. Note that as no other parameters
are set these would be taken as default. In the second line we send
another Note event modifying the existing pitch for the previously
started Note. Finally in the third line we send a global parameter
change that will affect the whole score.

<P>
It is interesting to note that, as S. T. Pope points out in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSuperCollider">Pope, 2004</A>],
most software synthesis systems have some sort of note statement consisting
of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">keyword</SPAN>, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">start time</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">duration</SPAN> of
the event, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument</SPAN> and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">parameters</SPAN> of the
Instrument. <SPAN  CLASS="textit"></SPAN>In our model the variable is equivalent to the
keyword, the time statement to the start time and the parameter/parameter
value pairs to the generic parameters. But there are some differences.
A first important difference is that the note event does not necessarily
have to address an Instrument as it can address a particular Generator
or a whole Instrument section or Instrument. Another important difference
is that we do not require a note event to include a duration and this
is treated as another regular parameter that may or may not be specified
in a note event. This is in fact one of the main limitations of the
Music-N model reported by different authors. Miller Puckette, for
instance, states in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PucketteFTS">Puckette, 1991b</A>] that the Music-N model is
not well suited to situations in which some aspects of a sound are
not defined at its beginning and he adds that those are in fact most
of the interesting situations.
