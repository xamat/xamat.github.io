The framework development process
</H2>

<P>
There are quite a few documented methodologies for developing a framework.
Most of them, though, admit the fact that the objective is to identify
abstractions with a bottom-up approach: start by examining existing
solutions and be able to generalize from them. When adopting a framework
development process it is important to take into account that any
framework will usually start as a white-box framework and ideally
evolve into a black-box one. It is also important to understand that
developing a framework is more difficult than developing and application
because users must be able to understand many design decisions. For
this reason it is even more important to follow good design practices
and principles.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#JohnsonDesignFrameworksOOPSLATutorial">Johnson, 1993</A>] the author explains
the difference between the ``ideal'' and the ``good'' way
to develop frameworks and software in general. The ideal consists
on three basic phases. First analyze the problem domain, learning
abstractions and collecting examples of programs to be built. Then
design abstractions that can be specialized to cover all the examples
and derive a theory to explain these applications. And finally test
the framework by using it to solve the examples. This ideal is impossible
to follow thoroughly for two main reasons: it is very difficult and
time consuming to do an exhaustive domain analysis, analyzing all
the possible existing examples; and old applications work so there
is no financial incentive to convert them to use new software. So
a less-than-ideal-but-good way to develop a framework is to first
pick two applications in the domain that are supposed to be solved
using the framework; make sure that at least some of the developers
in the team have developed applications for that particular domain;
and divide project into three groups: a framework group, which both
gives and takes software, considers how other applications would reuse
the framework and develops documentation and training; and two application
groups that try to reuse as much software in the framework as possible
and complain about how hard it is to reuse.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BoschFrameworksProblemsExperiences">Bosch et&nbsp;al., 1999</A>] the authors give a different
(though complementary) overview of the framework development process.
First they distinguish two different activities in framework development:
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">core framework design</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">framework internal increments</SPAN>.
Core framework design comprises both abstract and concrete classes
in the domain. The concrete classes are intended to be invisible and
transparent to the end user (e.g. a basic storage utility) while the
abstract classes are either intended to be invisible or to be used
through subclassing. On the other hand framework internal increments
build additional classes that form a number of class libraries. They
capture common implementations of the core framework design and they
can be either subclasses representing common realizations of the concepts
captured by the superclasses or a collection of classes representing
the specification for a complete instantiation of the framework in
a particular context. A final application built from the framework
consists of some core framework designs, the framework internal increments
and an ``application-specific increment''.

<P>
In this model, the main phases in the development are: (1) a framework
development phase that is usually the most effort-consuming phase
and is aimed at producing a reusable design in a particular domain;
(2) a framework usage or instantiation phase where applications are
developed; and (3) a framework evolution and maintenance phase.

<P>
A number of activities can be identified in the first development
phase, namely domain analysis, architectural design, framework design,
framework implementation, framework testing an application testing.
When determining the domain scope there is a problem of choosing the
correct size: if the framework is too large, many specialists maybe
needed in the team and the process may become long and expensive;
if the framework is too narrow it may have to be tailored for every
new application that comes up. Since the framework may be used in
many, sometimes unknown ways, it may simply not be feasible to test
all aspects of the framework. Since the framework relies on some parts
implemented by the user it may be impossible to test completely before
its release.

<P>
In the framework usage phase, the main activities involved are: domain
analysis, architectural design, framework design, framework implementation,
framework testing an application testing. In this phase an important
question is to be faced. If an error in the framework is found when
developing an application: who is going to fix the error in the framework?
and, should the applications that are working and are apparently not
affected by this error upgrade to the latest release of the framework?

<P>
It is also interesting to take a look at how a company such as the
Swiss Ericsson models the framework development process. Ericsson
Software Technology Frameworks have a template methodology that is
instantiated with every new framework design and that can be summarized
in the following guidelines (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#EricssonOOFrameworks">Landis and Niklasson, 1995</A>]): A
list of requirements on at least two applications should be provided
together with a list of requirements on the framework. A list of future
requirements should also be provided. The project team should include
members with knowledge of each application and a member with knowledge
on framework design. Information should be gathered from as many sources
as possible. Requirements and use cases should be separated into framework-specific
and application-specific and they should also be divided into functional
and non-functional. High-level abstractions should be identified,
preparing for the identification of the framework. But only abstractions
that are in the framework domain should be introduced and afterwards
they should be named the same in the static model. Existing solutions
should be examined and large frameworks should be structured into
sub-frameworks. A static model for each application should be developed
then introducing abstractions common to several applications into
the framework. Using graphical notations the project should be presented
clearly to all project members. Subsystems should have high cohesion
and little coupling. Finally existing frameworks should be studied
trying to reuse as much design as possible.

<P>
And according to the previously mentioned Taligent, the process for
developing frameworks must observe four important guidelines that
can be understood as a summary of the previous list [<A
 HREF="node207.html#AdairBuildingOOFrameworks">Adair, 1995</A>]:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Derive frameworks from existing problems and solutions
</LI>
<LI>Develop small, focused frameworks.
</LI>
<LI>Build frameworks using an iterative process driven by client participation
and prototyping.
</LI>
<LI>Treat frameworks as products by providing documentation and support,
and by planning for distribution and maintenance.
</LI>
</UL>
And related to the framework development process it is finally interesting
to note that as Opdyke points out [<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpdykeThesis">Opdyke, 1992</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#OpdykeJohnsonRefactoringInFrameworks">Opdyke and Johnson, 1990</A>]
one of the main characteristics of a framework is that it is designed
to be refined, good frameworks are usually the result of many design
iterations and a lot of work involving sometimes structural changes.
