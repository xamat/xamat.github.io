Frameworks generate metamodels
</H2>

<P>
From what has been explained up until now it is clear that when building
an application framework we are generalizing across a set of systems
that usually belong to a particular domain. We aim at offering the
tools and the conceptual infrastructure needed to implement all those
systems. A framework is not just about reuse of code but also about
conceptual reuse. A well designed framework should present a precise
model of computation and conceptual basis.

<P>
This ``conceptual framework'' is in fact a metamodel that can
be instantiated as a model to implement a desired application or domain
service.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MeequelFromModelsToFrameworks">Meequel et&nbsp;al., 1997</A>] the authors explain a method
for designing a framework. The method is based on a domain analysis.
Although they recognize that the framework development process is
iterative by nature, their method proposes the following phases for
framework design:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>domain analysis: analyze products in the domain, commonalities and
variations.
</LI>
<LI>architecture: high-level partitioning of the software system into
component.
</LI>
<LI>subsystem/component design
</LI>
</OL>
It is our belief that this traditional view of ``analysis-first''
process models is seldom appropriate for framework design (some authors
argue that this approach is not appropriate for any kind of software
design process). When designing a framework it is obvious that some
initial domain analysis must be performed in order to understand basic
requirements and different viewpoints represented by different stakeholders.
But we cannot aim at understanding and modeling the whole domain from
the start, it is important to remember that when building a framework
we are not only implementing an infrastructure for existing applications
but also thinking about future development in the domain.

<P>
We believe in an application-driven approach as that presented by
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#JohnsonDesignFrameworksOOPSLATutorial">Johnson, 1993</A>] in which the framework
development process is iterative and where the user feedback is necessary
on a regular basis. Such a process model has proven useful in our
case. Not only is not necessary to have a previous domain analysis
model before starting the framework design, it is the framework design
that ends up generating an appropriate domain metamodel. Therefore,
and already commented in section <A HREF="node21.html#sub:Metamodels">1.2.4</A>, frameworks
generate metamodels.
