Sinusoidal plus Residual Model</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Sinusoidal plus Residual model can cover a wide &#34;compromise
space&#34; and can in fact be seen as the generalization of both
the STFT and the Sinusoidal models. Using this approach, we can decide
what part of the spectral information is modeled as sinusoids and
what is left as STFT. With a good analysis, the Sinusoidal plus Residual
representation is very flexible while maintaining a good sound fidelity,
and the representation is quite efficient. In this approach, the Sinusoidal
representation is used to model only the stable partials of a sound.
The residual, or its approximation, models what is left, which should
ideally be a stochastic component. This model is less general than
either the STFT or the Sinusoidal representations but it results in
an enormous gain in flexibility [<A
 HREF="node207.html#SerraPhd">Serra, 1989</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#SerraSMSBook">Serra, 1996</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#SerraSMSCMJ">Serra, 1990</A>].

<P>
The sinusoidal plus residual model assumes that the sinusoids are
stable partials of the sound with a slowly changing amplitude and
frequency. With this restriction, we are able to add major constraints
to the detection of sinusoids in the spectrum and omit the detection
of the phase of each peak. 

<P>
Within this model we can either leave the residual signal, , to be
the difference between the original sound and the sinusoidal component,
resulting into an identity system, or we can assume that&nbsp; is a stochastic
signal. In this case, the residual can be described as filtered white
noise. That is, the residual is modeled by the time-domain convolution
of white noise with a time-varying frequency-shaping filter. 

<P>
The implementation of the analysis for the Sinusoidal plus Residual
Model is more complex than the one for the Sinusoidal Model. Figure
<A HREF="#fig:SMS-analysis-algorithm">B.1</A> shows a simplified block- diagram
of this analysis.

The first few steps are the same than in a sinusoidal-only analysis.
The major differences start on the peak continuation process since
in order to have a good partial-residual decomposition we have to
refine the peak-continuation process in such a way as to be able to
identify the stable partials of the sound. Several strategies can
be used to accomplish this. The simplest case is when the sound is
monophonic and pseudo-harmonic. By using the fundamental frequency
information in the peak continuation algorithm, we can identify the
harmonic partials.

<P>
The residual component is obtained by first generating the sinusoidal
component with additive synthesis, and then subtracting it from the
original waveform. This is possible because the instantaneous phases
of the original sound are matched and therefore the shape of the time
domain waveform preserved. A spectral analysis of this time domain
residual is done by first windowing it, window which is independent
of the one used to find sinusoids, and thus we are free to choose
a different time-frequency compromise. An amplitude correction step
can improve the time smearing produced in the sinusoidal subtraction.
Then the FFT is computed and the resulting spectrum can be modeled
using several existing techniques. The spectral phases might be discarded
if the residual can be approximated as a stochastic signal.

<P>
Once the different components in the SMS have been obtained, different
interesting transformations can be applied in the spectral domain
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatDAFXChapter">Amatriain et&nbsp;al., 2002b</A>]. After processing the spectral components,
these must be synthesized back to produce the output sound. The diagram
in figure <A HREF="#fig:SMS-Synthesis-Algorithm">B.2</A> illustrates the SMS synthesis
algorithm.

The original sinusoidal plus residual model has led to other different
spectral models that still share some of its basis. [Ding and Qian,
