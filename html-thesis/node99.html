General Processing</A>
</H4>

<P>
In this first category different signal processing algorithms can
be found. Although these algorithms can be considered general purpose
and can be applied to different domains, there is a clear focus on
spectral processing of audio and more precisely on the Spectral Modeling
Synthesis (SMS) technique (see Annex <A HREF="node230.html#sec:_Spectral_Processing">B</A>). 

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt1781">Analysis</SPAN>

<P>
The Processing classes included in this category are used to extract
different features from the input signal. All the necessary algorithms
related to the SMS analysis process are included. Therefore, we can
find Processings for: window generation, signal shifting, performing
the FFT, detecting and tracking spectral peaks, detecting the fundamental
frequency, extracting the spectral envelop, performing the LPC autocorrelation,
and segmenting the audio signal.

<P>
The spectral analysis and the SMS analysis Processings represent a
special kind of Processing that do not encapsulate a single algorithm
but rather use existing simple Processings to build a new one out
of their composition. Such Processings are called Processing Composites.
In the case of the spectral analysis Processing is composed from the
following Processings: window generator, circular shift, FFT and audio
multiplier. The SMS analysis Processing adds another layer of composition
as it includes the previously commented spectral analysis plus other
Processings such as spectral peak detection or fundamental frequency
detection.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt1782">Transformations</SPAN>

<P>
Transformations are divided into general purpose transformations and
those that can only be applied to the output of the SMS analysis process.
General transformations include some time-domain algorithms such as
delay, normalization or envelope modulator. It also includes spectral
transformations like frequency domain filtering by applying an ideal
function or an spectral envelope.

<P>
But using the SMS model more interesting transformations can be applied
also in the spectral domain [<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatDAFXChapter">Amatriain et&nbsp;al., 2002b</A>]. The repository
offers SMS-based transformations such as time-stretch, morphing or
pitch shifting. These transformations are sub-categorized under the
Transformations-&gt;SMS category.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt1784">Synthesis</SPAN>

<P>
The synthesis algorithms are all the necessary for the SMS model.
Nevertheless, some of them (such as the inverse FFT or the overlap
and add) can be applied to different spectral models. 

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt1785">Generators</SPAN>

<P>
Generators are special Processings that produce but do not consume
data. The CLAM repository of generators includes algorithms like oscillators,
wave generators or ADSR (attack-decay-sustain release) envelopes.
