<P>
SndObj [<A
 HREF="node207.html#LazzariniSndObjOrganized00">Lazzarini, 2000b</A>] is an OO sound synthesis
and processing programming library released under the GPL designed
for the development of music applications as well as research and
implementation of DSP algorithms. SndObj is written in C++ and it
can be deployed in music software applications as a toolkit or as
a framework for developing and implemented new sound processing algorithms.
In the first releases SndObj processed on a sample by sample basis
but as this proved not efficient, from version 2.0 on it processes
vectors (see the following references for an overview of the library's
evolution: [<A
 HREF="node207.html#LazzariniOrganizedSound98">Lazzarini, 1998</A>,<A

 HREF="node207.html#LazzariniSndObjDafx01">Lazzarini, 2001</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-SndObj">www-SndObj, </A>]).

<P>
SndObj has three important characteristics: (1) Encapsulation: it
encapsulates all the processes involved with production, control,
manipulation, storage and performance of audio data. (2) Modularity:
processing objects can be freely associated as modules in an analogue
synthesizer or unit generators in a computer music system. (3) Portability:
the core is portable to any platform with a POSIX compliant C++ compiler.
Some classes as real-time IO are platform specific. It has been developed
on different platforms: Sun Sparc under Solaris, IBM RISC 2000 under
AIX, SGI O2 under IRIX, and Intel PC under Linux and Windows (using
Cygwin and gnu g++). The latest beta version has been released for
Windows, Linux and IRIX.

<P>
There are four base classes in the framework: <TT>SndObj</TT> for
signal processing related objects, <TT>SndIO</TT> for signal input/output
objects, Table for mathematical functions and <TT>SndThread</TT> for
thread management.

<P>
Objects of the <TT>SndObj</TT> class share some properties such as
the sampling rate, output vector size, an output buffer, a <TT>SndObj</TT>
input object and an on/off switch. They also share methods for the
basic operations such as addition, subtraction and multiplication
as well as methods for setting and retrieving their basic attributes,
this includes retrieving samples from the output buffer. The <TT>SndObj</TT>
classes also include a main processing method, <TT>DoProcess()</TT>
which is overridable. This is where each derived class implements
a particular algorithm. The <TT>SndObj</TT> object will typically
access the output signal of an input object and perform the processing
that will eventually fill the output buffer. The default <TT>DoProcess()</TT>
implemented in the base class just copies from the input object to
the output buffer. The <TT>SndObj</TT> base class has a single input
but derived classes can have any number (even none as is the case
of some generators).

<P>
Objects of the <TT>SndIO</TT> class tree are designed to deal with
input and output of audio. They implement five basic tasks: standard
IO, soundfile IO, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital IO, buffer
memory (RAM) IO and MIDI input. The base <TT>SndIO</TT> class implements
a very simple standard IO. The most important methods are the <TT>Read</TT>
and <TT>Write</TT> operations. They operate on vectors just like the
<TT>SndObj</TT> classes. <TT>SndIO</TT> classes can receive input
from <TT>SndObj</TT> objects and can send signal to special <TT>SndObj</TT>
classes such as <TT>MidiIn</TT> and <TT>Bend</TT>. Some <TT>SndIO</TT>
classes are platform dependent and even have different interface depending
on the platform. <TT>SndRTIO</TT> and <TT>SndMidi/SndMidiIn</TT> are
only implemented in three platforms (Linux/OSS, SGI and Windows)

<P>
Finally, the <TT>SndThread</TT> class encapsulates the main process
loop as a separate POSIX thread. Apart from that it offers very small
functionality as it is still ongoing work.

<P>
The library is distributed with a number of examples that present
in a simple way the use of SndObj. Cvoc, for instance, is a simple
phase vocoder based on Butterworth filters. There are also some examples
of MIDI usage such as Pluck, a Karplus-Strong based plucked-string
synthesizer. SndObj can be integrated into GUI frameworks such as
MFC and V and there some examples of such functionality.
