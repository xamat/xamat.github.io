Future Work
</H1>

<P>
Finally we will mention the main lines of research that remain open
after finishing this Thesis. We will outline them in relation to the
main contributions of the thesis: the CLAM framework, the DSPOOM metamodel,
the OOCTM metamodel and the MetriX object-oriented music model.

<P>
In relation to the CLAM framework, in section <A HREF="node214.html#sec:CLAMWhat_sNext">A.1</A>
we describe what are the main future lines of development. The main
idea is that the framework's usability can still be improved in different
ways and by doing so we believe that it will be accepted more naturally
by more users. In order to do so we must address issues such as an
easier deployment in any platform, a cleaner and clearer interface
or the addition of more automatic flow control tools. All these issues
are detailed in annex <A HREF="#ch:_Future_Work">6.5</A>.

<P>
The Digital Signal Processing Object-Oriented Metamodel (DSPOOM) is
complete and demonstrated through the CLAM framework. Nevertheless,
we claimed that the metamodel is valid for any digital signal processing
model and this still has to be tested thoroughly. Although some initial
experiments confirm that the metamodel is useful in other domains
such as image processing it should be tested in different situations
and under different conditions. It is possible that the usage of the
metamodel in different situations may end up reverting into the metamodel
itself clarifying some details such as the convenience of using one
graphical MoC or another (see section <A HREF="node153.html#sec:DSPOOM-graphical-MoC">4.3</A>).

<P>
The Object-Oriented Content Transmission Metamodel (OOCTM) has been
partially instantiated and demonstrated especially through content-based
transformations (see <A HREF="node178.html#sec:Content-based-transformations">5.3.4</A>). Nevertheless,
the overall metamodel could be only proven through a rather limited
application (see <A HREF="node179.html#sec:OOCTM-Sample-applications">5.4</A>). These limitations
are due to some restrictions especially on the analyzer process. This
block addresses problems such as automatic instrument classification
or musical transcription, which are still unsolved research topics.
The full strength of the metamodel will only be visible when this
technologies are finally available. Nevertheless we believe that its
formulation will help in structuring related systems and already gives
a conceptual framework for research in this area. In this sense it
will also be important to exploit OOCTM's relation to other more well-stablished
models/metamodels such as Structured Audio or S&amp;W (see <A HREF="node169.html#sec:OOCTM-and-related-models">5.3</A>).

<P>
Finally we already commented that the MetriX music model presented
in chapter <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A> does not intend to be as general
as the other metamodels previously presented. MetriX is used as a
proof of concept and demonstration that the object-oriented paradigm
and the DSPOOM metamodel in particular may be used to effectively
model the symbolic music domain. Nevertheless, we believe that the
resulting model could with minor enhancements become of general applicability.
The major shortcomings of the models are that it lacks a way of describing
performers and that analysis information is not fully integrated. 

<P>
Concentrating on the former limitation we observe that any music performance
is made of at least three main actors: the score, the instrument,
and the performer. The performer reads and interprets the score and
acts on the instrument accordingly. The definition of Score in our
OO music model is a hybrid between the traditional score written by
a composer and the interpretation given by the performer. We would
like to have a more clear distinction between the three levels and
would therefore be interested in defining a third ``document''
specifying how a performer behaves. This file would contain a list
of constraints to be applied to the way score events would be sent
to the instrument.

<P>
As for the second limitation, it would be interesting to better integrate
MetriX with our OOCTM. In order to do so new ways to include analysis
information into both the Score and the Instrument definition need
to be devised. By doing so we would be accomplishing a more compact
conceptual integration of the three main axis in this thesis: CLAM/DSPOOM,
OOCTM and MetriX.

<P>
It is clear that any piece of work leaves many open issues and lines
of future research. It is even more so in a Thesis such as this where
models of very general applicability are presented. Nevertheless it
is important to ask oneself whether the ground that has been built
is solid enough so as to continue constructing from it. In this sense
we believe that we have accomplished our goals and we hope to have
contributed to the advance of not only present but also future research
in our field.
