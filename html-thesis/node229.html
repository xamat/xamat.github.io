<P>
Although CLAM is already available, at the time of this writing its
usage is still mainly internal to the MTG. It is still too early to
evaluate its public acceptance. It is important to note that the framework
will not be publicly advertised in a general sense until it reaches
its 1.0 release.

<P>
Internally CLAM has been used in many different projects all of them
already reviewed in section <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>.

<P>
As for its external usage it may be mentioned that the CLAM mailing-list
has now well above 100 subscribed members, of which about 25 are external
to the MTG (note that we are considering students from the university
also as internal users although they formally are not). The truth
is that these members are not very active and, although we know they
are using CLAM we do not have any news of what have been the final
upcoming of their initial efforts.
