<P>
Release 0.6 is the latest major release at the time of this writing.
The major goal in this release has been to come up with a fully functional
Network Editor promoting the use of automatic flow control policies
and dynamic networks. Many efforts have been put into enhancing CLAM's
easiness of deployment by finally building binaries of the library.

<P>
Another important issue is the simplification of public interfaces
of the main CLAM base classes. It has become clear that many of them
were overdesigned and more features than needed were present. The
goal is now to offer as simple interfaces as possible in order to
make life easier to CLAM users in a white-box manner.

<P>
In this release we abandoned support to Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and
all its non-standard features and turned to the much better compiler
in Microsoft Visual .Net for the Microsoft Windows platform. We also
added better support for the QT GUI framework, which will become the
preferred framework from now on instead of the FLTK toolkit.

<P>
Up until this release, CLAM only accepted 16 bit wav, AIFF and raw
sound files. With the inclusion of some external libraries, now we
are able to accept virtually any PCM format, Vorbis OGG and MP3. See
<A HREF="node228.html#sec:_CLAM_External_Libraries">A.2</A> for a brief explanation on the
external libraries that are used.

<P>
Finally, a major rework and testing was done on the Descriptors infrastructure
and repository.

<P>
Release 0.6 is at the time of this writing still unfinished. Therefore
many of the advances accomplished are very much related with the ``CLAM
Roadmap towards version 1.0'' that will be commented in the next
section.
