Beyond Parametric Encoding: Content Analysis
</H2>

<P>
Any parameterized audio coding format can be considered as a combination
of: a sound-understanding algorithm that sets parameter according
to some model by analyzing the audio; the transmission of these parameters;
and a sound-synthesis algorithm that maps from the transmitted parameters
to a new sound [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScheirerSAKolmogorov">Scheirer, 2001</A>]. 

<P>
The understanding step is usually called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">encoding</SPAN> and the
synthesis step <SPAN  CLASS="textit">decoding</SPAN> but if the parameters are obtained
directly from a sound, the process may be also termed as analysis/synthesis.
If we want to communicate the sound description over a channel we
need an encoder and a decoder, both with a priori knowledge of the
model being used. But it is impossible to devise an encoding method
that always gives the optimal coding of any input sound. In other
words, not a single model can fit all kinds of input signals. For
this reason we may sum up different specialized models and add some
extra bits to the stream in order to indicate what model is being
chosen.

<P>
Parametric encoding has been used extensively in speech transmission,
where a general model of the input signal has existed for a long time.
Most commonly used parametric models for speech are simple variations
of the classical Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) scheme[<A
 HREF="node207.html#LPC">Makhoul, 1975</A>],
which somehow exploits the knowledge of the vocal production mechanism.

<P>
Parametric coding for non-speech signals is much more complex to implement
as not many assumptions can be made about the source characteristics
or its production mechanisms. MPEG-4 standardized different parametric
encoding schemes although the one recommended for non-speech or musical
signals is the HILN or Harmonic and Individual Lines plus Noise (see
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#HILN-MP4Parametric">Purnhagen and Meine, 2000</A>]). This parametric scheme is as a matter
of fact a variation of the SMS or Spectral Modelling Synthesis technique
(see further explanation in annex <A HREF="node230.html#sec:_Spectral_Processing">B</A>).

<P>
The Object-Oriented Content Transmission metamodel represents a step
beyond parametric encoding. The basic scheme is the same: the sound
is analyzed, some parameters are extracted, transmitted and then synthesized
back at the receiver.

<P>
But the main difference is on the kind of parametric model used in
each case. In traditional parametric encoding, the model makes assumptions
about the low-level features of the signal. For instance, the input
signal may be supposed to be harmonic and therefore modeled as a set
of time varying sinusoids (see Annex <A HREF="node230.html#sec:_Spectral_Processing">B</A>
for a more in depth explanation of one of these models).

<P>
In the Object-Oriented Content Transmission Metamodel we make assumptions
about the semantics of the input data and the way it is organized
in the real world. We may, for instance, assume that the input signal
will be monophonic musical phrases and then apply a model in which
a musical phrase is modelled as a sequence of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">notes</SPAN>.

<P>
The OOCTM encodes data as Sound Objects. This is, as already mentioned
in the previous section, a particular case of Parametric encoding.
Parameters extracted from the signal become attributes of concrete
objects. In that sense, all parameters have a particular meaning and
contribute to the content description. The final encoded signal also
has a clear structure, given by the resulting object-oriented model.

<P>
In that sense, the result of an OOCTM encoding is generally understandable
while a Parametric encoding is usually not.

<P>
Finally, in a Parametric encoding scheme the synthesis capabilities
of the receiver are very much limited to a simple signal model. In
the OOCTM scheme the synthesizer is able to not only apply different
models but also to infer or abstract a sound from an incomplete description
(see <A HREF="node165.html#sub:The-Semantic-Receiver">5.2.2</A>).
