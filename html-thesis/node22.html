Metaphors </A>
</H2>

<P>
Kent Beck is one of the most influential people in modern software
engineering. He is the father of the eXtreme Programming methodology,
the CRC cards and the first one to envision the use of software patterns
(see section <A HREF="node29.html#sub:Patterns">1.3.6</A>). One of the fundamental issues in
XP is the importance of using metaphors. 

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BeckMetaphorMetaphor">Beck, 2002</A>] the author informally defines the
idea of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">metaphor</SPAN> as well as a set of concepts that are related
to them. For the purpose of this discussion it it interesting to take
a look at some of them: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Metonymy</SPAN> is to refer to a whole by a part
</LI>
<LI>A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">simile</SPAN> is an explicit comparison
</LI>
<LI>An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">analogy</SPAN> is an explicit comparison where the parts are connected
</LI>
<LI>And a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">metaphor</SPAN> is the linking two sets of concepts; The understanding
itself of one set of concepts in terms of another
</LI>
</UL>
A metaphor is made of a source, a target and a mapping. According
to Beck, what makes metaphors useful is ``the game of is/is not'',
which helps thinking about the problem and understanding it. A metaphor
is best understood if it is based in a ``ground metaphor'', that
is it has a physical experience basis.

<P>
Metaphors are constantly used in software design. Icons, for instance,
in a graphical user interface are based on metaphors (the pencil,
the paint bucket or the sand clock). But is probably in the XP community
where this concept has become especially important. A key point to
the XP methodology is what they call <SPAN  CLASS="textit">System Metaphor</SPAN> which
is a simple shared story of how the system works[<A
 HREF="node207.html#BeckXP">Beck, 1999</A>]. That
is a story that everyone - costumers, programmers, a nd managers -
can tell about how the system works. A proper system metaphor supports
four basic aspects of system building: common vision, shared vocabulary,
generativity and architecture. It is also sometimes seen as a valid
substitution for what in most methodologies is called the system architecture
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#WestMetaphor">West, 2002</A>].

<P>
Some authors go even beyond this use of metaphor and claim that in
object-oriented design a program is a metaphor of the real world [<A
 HREF="node207.html#NobleMetaphorAndMetonymyInOO">Noble et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>].
The authors argue that the objects used in the object-oriented program
are not the same kind as real-world objects. Objects in the design
are not ``abstractions'' of the real-world objects because real
objects are not instances of the software ones, rather the relationship
between software objects and external objects can be seen as a ``metaphor''. 

<P>
But how does this concept relate to the ones previously introduced?
It is our opinion that the use of the metaphor concept in software
engineering is misleading. Most of the times when talking about a
system metaphor what we are actually doing is to describe a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">model</SPAN>.
Let us remember that a model does not need to either be formal or
to completely describe a system under study and the correctness of
a model is only measured in relation to how well it accomplishes its
purpose. The purpose of a conceptual model can be, as already commented
in section <A HREF="node18.html#sec:_Models">1.2.2</A>, to communicate ideas. This is basically
the same idea as the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">system metaphor</SPAN>. 

<P>
The only problem with using the metaphor as a driving force throughout
the development is that it promotes the idea that the system is static
in two ways. First, a real metaphor is usually difficult to find but
even more difficult to change once adopted. Conceptual changes introduced
later in the development may contradict one of the underlying ideas
in the metaphor. Although the metaphor can then be updated, chances
are that it will then become misleading. On the other hand, if we
think on models we think on a continuous of different models that
evolve from the most abstract and conceptual one we may have in the
very initial phases to the executable model or code itself. This idea
of the model being able to describe the system at different levels
of abstraction is also lost when using the system metaphor paradigm.
