Dataflow Networks
</H3>

<P>
Dataflow Networks is a graphical MoC very closely related to Process
Networks. In this model arcs also represent FIFO queues. But now the
nodes of the graph, instead of representing processes, represent <SPAN  CLASS="textit">actors</SPAN>.
Instead of responding to the simple the blocking-read semantics of
Process Networks, actors use <SPAN  CLASS="textit">firing rules</SPAN> that specify how
many tokens must be available on every input for the actor to fire
(see figure <A HREF="#fig:Dataflow-Process-Network">1.5</A>). When an actor fires,
it consumes a finite number of tokens and produces also a finite number
of output tokens. A process can be formed by repeated firings of a
dataflow actor.

<P>
An actor may have more than one firing rule. The evaluation of the
firing rules is sequential in the sense that rules are sequentially
evaluated until at least one of them is satisfied. Thus an actor can
only fire if one or more than one of its firing rules are satisfied.
In general, though, synchronous dataflow actors have a single firing
rule of the same kind: a number of tokens that must be available at
each of the inputs. For example, an adder with two inputs has a single
firing rule saying that each input must at least have one token.

<P>
As pointed out by [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ParksProcessNetworksPhD">Parks, 1995</A>] breaking down processes
into smaller units such as dataflow actors firings, makes efficient
implementations possible. Restricting the type of dataflow actors
to those that have a predictable consumption and production pattern
makes it possible to perform static, off-line analysis to bound the
memory. 

<P>
In Dataflow Networks instead of suspending a process on blocking read
or non-blocking write, processes are freely interleaved by a scheduler
that determines the sequence of actor firings. The biggest advantage
is that the cost of process suspension and resumption is avoided[<A
 HREF="node207.html#LeeAndTomasDataflowNetworks">Lee and Park, 1995</A>]. 

<P>
In many signal processing applications the firing sequence can be
determined statically at compile time. The class of dataflow process
networks where this is possible are called ``synchronous dataflow
networks'' and will be commented in next section. 

<P>
Dataflow graphs have data-driven semantics. The availability of operands
enables the operator and hence sequencing constraints follow only
from data availability. This feature has its limitations. The principal
strength of dataflow networks is that they do not over-specify an
algorithm by imposing unnecessary sequencing constraints between operators
