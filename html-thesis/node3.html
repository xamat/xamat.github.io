Conceptual Roadmap 
</H1>

<P>
First, it may be interesting to briefly discuss what is the purpose
of coming up with a domain metamodel. As a matter of fact, the main
reason and advantage of working on a domain metamodel is the same
as the reason for working on a system model: come up with a simplified
representation of the domain that helps its understanding and usability.
The domain metamodel can then be instantiated to model different systems
related to the domain and therefore build a set of related applications.

<P>
Note also that when building an application framework we are also
in some way trying to come up with a (practical) domain metamodel.
We are in fact trying to find a simplified representation of the domain
that can be used to easily construct new applications related with
that domain. A framework does not only give a set of tools that can
be used as building pieces (black-box framework) but also a conceptual
interpretation of the domain (white-box framework) (see <A HREF="node26.html#sec:FrameworkClassification">1.3.3</A>).
One way to see the process of building a framework is that we must
first have to come up with a domain model and then implement it. Nevertheless,
if we adopt a more incremental or ``agile'' point of view, we
are able to see it the other way around: when we start building the
framework we may have a vague idea of the domain model or metaphor
but it is the process of designing the framework that actually ends-up
defining the model. All these issues will be contextualized and further
developed in chapter <A HREF="node6.html#ch:_FoundationalIssues">1</A>.

<P>
This thesis presents an object-oriented metamodel for signal processing
that will be called Digital Signal Processing Object-Oriented Metamodel,
DSPOOM for short. DSPOOM is a metamodel that, as it will be proven
throughout this work, can be used to effectively translate any digital
signal processing system into the software domain. This modeling is
accomplished through the use of the object oriented paradigm and,
in doing so, we gain more understanding - and thus control - of the
different actors and forces present in the original system.

<P>
After this introduction, in chapter <A HREF="node6.html#ch:_FoundationalIssues">1</A>
we will review the basic foundational concepts upon which the thesis
is built. Departing from the initial glossary this chapter will focus
on establishing a solid ground by clearly defining the main axis:
the concept of model, the object oriented paradigm and associated
techniques and uses, and a review of different models that have been
traditionally been used for modeling signal processing or digital
communication systems. In this chapter we will also discuss on issues
such as frameworks, models and metamodels. A somehow more extensive
review is given of software engineering techniques as the readers
are not expected to be experts in the software engineering domain.

<P>
Chapter <A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A> presents thorough review
of software environments for audio and music processing. Each of them
responds to a different rationale, focus and general model. The analysis
of these tools is a vital task for understanding the domain in which
this thesis is built. Many of these environments also represent clear
predecessors, not only of the framework that will be presented in
the following chapter but also of the different conceptual models
and metamodels that are later derived. 

<P>
In next chapter, number <A HREF="node92.html#ch:_CLAM">3</A>, the CLAM framework for developing
audio and music applications is presented. CLAM is at the same time
a proof of concept and the generating seed of the model presented
in this Thesis and commented in the next chapter. As a matter of fact,
implicit to this thesis is the idea that frameworks generate models,
and not the other way around (see <A HREF="node28.html#sub:Frameworks-generate-metamodels">1.3.5</A>).

<P>
In chapter <A HREF="node135.html#ch:_DSPOOM">4</A> the main issues and concepts that form
DSPOOM are discussed. The central part of this chapter is devoted
to explaining a classification of digital signal processing objects
that may be used to model a system.

<P>
In chapter <A HREF="node155.html#ch:_OOCTM">5</A> we defend that the model presented, and
the framework that realizes it, can be effectively used for working
with new paradigms that go beyond the classical signal processing
framework. More precisely, DSPOOM is shown to be useful as the basis
for a content processing or semantic framework.

<P>
In chapter <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A> we finish the excursion up the
abstraction ladder and end up presenting an object oriented model
for music (i.e. symbolic) processing. It is not the first time that
music and objects meet, but here we discuss how the model is related
to the one presented for the lower signal level and can use many tools
included in the CLAM framework.

<P>
Finally, in chapter <A HREF="node204.html#cha:Conclusions-and-Future">6.5</A> we draw some
conclusions and envision some future work that could be used to broaden
the scope of this Thesis.
