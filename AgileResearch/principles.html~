<i>We follow these principles:</i>
</font>

<p><font size="+2">
Our highest priority is to satisfy society<br>
through early, open, and continuous delivery<br>
of valuable scientific research results.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Acknowledge the need to continously adapt <br>
tools and approaches to meet changing needs <br>
and to respond to other results
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Deliver research results open and frequently, from a <br>
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a <br>
preference to the shorter timescale.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Researchers and other stakeholders in charge <br>
of making results usable, such as engineers, <br>
developers, or business people must work <br>
together daily throughout the project.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Build projects around motivated individuals. <br>
Give them the environment and support they need, <br>
and trust them to get the job done.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The most efficient and effective method of <br>
conveying information to and within a research <br>
team is face-to-face conversation.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Useful research is the primary measure of progress.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Agile processes promote sustainable research. <br>
The sponsors, researchers, and developers should be able <br>
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Continuous attention to scientific excellence <br>
and good scientific practices enhances agility.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount <br>
of work not done--is essential.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The best theories, solutions, and results <br>
emerge from self-organizing teams.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
At regular intervals, the scientific team reflects on how <br>
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts <br>
its behavior accordingly.
