<br>
What I've done </div>
<p class="main"> Although I started studying music when I was quite
little, I did not take it seriously until I was 15. As a teenager I played in a number
of bands the most successful of which was the Maijalas. <br>
<br>
<br>
Carles Lloveras, Xavi Palou, Ramon Valls and I created the Maijalas
band. The idea was to mix rock with more latin rithms (nowadays I know
that is very common but not so much at that time). Maijalas got to record a demo tape and a CD. We
broke up when we were preparing our second CD. Here you have a few
samples from our first CD <img src="samples.png"

<br>
I have also done quite a few computer based compositions. Unfortunately because of a severe lack of time in the past few years none of them have made it to a stage in which I would be comfortable sharing them. I have done compositions using MetriX (the language I developed), CSound, CLAM and Pd.
