<p class="p3">(I am pretty good at keeping my <a href="http://technocalifornia.blogspot.com/"><span class="s1">blog</span></a> up to date. There you can have a good idea of what I am doing and thinking about.) <br>
I am currently a Research/Engineering Director at Netflix where I lead the Personalization Science and Engineering team. My technical area of expertise is on Recommender Systems, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, and User Modeling. <br>
<br>
<br>
In my previous position as a Senior Research Scientist, I was a member of the <a href="http://research.tid.es/"><span class="s1">Multimedia Research Group</span></a> in Telefonica Research Barcelona. <br>
<br>
Previously I was Associate Director for the Media Arts and Technology Initiatives (MATi) at the <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu/"><span class="s1">University of California Santa Barbara</span></a> and Research Director of the <a href="http://www.create.ucsb.edu/"><span class="s1">CREATE</span></a> research center at that same university. <br>
<br>
As MATi's Associate Director my main mandate was to organize the multimedia research community around the <a href="http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/allosphere"><span class="s1">Allosphere</span></a>. <br>
<br>
I created and led the development of the <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/clam"><span class="s1">CLAM</span></a> framework for some time. I am no longer active on the project. <br>
