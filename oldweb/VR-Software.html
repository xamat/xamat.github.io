<h2><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/syzygy.htm" target="_blank">Syzygy</a></h2>
<br>
Syzygy solves several problems: distributed graphics, distributed sound, distributed systems management, distributed data access, and general I/O device management. There are systems out there that do each of these things, but no one system addresses them all. However, each problem relies on a similar infrastructure for its solution. Syzygy aims to identify that common infrastructure and provide an implementation. Thus, each problem can be solved more easily, and the resulting code base is well-integrated, maintainable, and smaller. In effect, Syzygy is a middleware solution for distributed multimedia.

<h2><a href="http://www.uni-verse.org" target="_blank">Uni-verse</a></h2>
<br>
Our goal is to create an open source Internet platform for multi-user, interactive, distributed, high-quality 3D graphics and audio for home, public and personal use. The platform will support high-quality 3D-graphics as well as high-quality 3D-audio and acoustic simulation.

 <br>

The foundation of the platform is "Verse", a lightweight, low latency, general-purpose network protocol for 3D data, which lets multiple applications act together as one large system by sharing data over the network.

<P>FreeVR
is an open-source virtual reality interface/integration library. It
has been designed to work with a wide variety of input and output
hardware, with many device interfaces already implemented. One of the
design goals was for FreeVR applications to be easily run in existing

The other major design goal is to make it easier for VR applications
to be shared among active VR research sites using different hardware
from each other.</P>

<h2><A HREF="http://www.avango.org/">Avango</A></h2>
<P>
We present AVANGO, our object-oriented framework for the development of
distributed, interactive VE applications. Data distribution is
achieved by transparent replication of a shared scene graph among the
participating processes of a distributed application. A sophisticated
group communication system is used to guarantee state consistency
even in the presence of late joining and leaving processes. The
familiar dataflow graph found in modern stand-alone 3D-application
toolkits extends nicely to the distributed case.<BR><BR>Many toolkits
for the development of stand-alone VE applications exist today. They
provide the programmer with a high-level interface to represent
complex geometry in a scene graph and to render that scene graph. The
programmer is shielded from the details of dealing with low-level
graphics and system APIs, and can concentrate on the development of
the application itself.<BR><BR>AVANGO provides programmers with the
concept of a shared scene-graph, accessible from all processes
forming a distributed application. Each process owns a local copy of
the scene graph and the contained state information, which is kept
synchronized. Our object-oriented framework allows the creation of
application specific classes, which inherit these distribution
properties. Furthermore, the shared scene-graph is augmented with a
distributed dataflow graph. This provides the same evaluation
characteristics in distributed applications as in stand-alone
applications, and effectively supports the development of distributed
interactive applications. In contrast to similar systems like Repo-3D
(MacIntyre:1998) we focus on high-end, real-time, virtual
environments like CAVEs (Cruz-Neira:1993:SSP) and Workbenches
(HKP:Krueger94,HKP:Krueger95), therefore the development is based on
SGI Performer (Rohlf:1994:IPH).</P>

<P>
DIVERSE is a cross-platform, open

run almost anywhere. DIVERSE currently runs on Linux, IRIX. Support
for Windows XP and Mac OS X is under development. The goal of DIVERSE
is to enable developers to quickly build applications that will run
on the desktop as well as various immersive systems. To avoid
hindering development DIVERSE is designed without the &quot;center of
the universe&quot; paradigm; you only use the parts of DIVERSE that
you need. This allows DIVERSE to interact with many other APIs and
toolkits like, <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/" TARGET="_self">OpenGL</A>,

<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/maverik/maverik.html" target="_blank">Maverik</a></h2>
MAVERIK is designed to support 3D virtual environments, and interaction with those environments. It uses Mesa or OpenGL to perform low-level rendering, but includes a lot of stuff on top of this to render different kinds of objects, to manage environments and provide support for 3D interaction. MAVERIK is a VR application developers toolkit/framework; it is not an end-user application.
<br>
The system is designed to be fairly open-ended in the way that it represents different kinds of models. It uses call-back functions to do this, rather than importing and converting data to its own formats. This means that it can be adapted relatively easily to widely differing application data structures without forcing particular representations on the implementor. Thus, for example, if you have a simulation in which different parts of your model are varying dynamically, but in ways which cannot be represented using normal affine transformations (e.g. deformable objects), then MAVERIK will allow you to use the dynamically changing data directly to generate images.
<br>
It also contains support for a variety of 3D input devices, and various kinds of displays (including stereo).
<br>
Maverik runs on GNU/linux PCs, and Silicon Graphics workstations.

<BR>
<br>
In the Virginia Tech CAVE, we perceive a significant need to address
fundamental human factors and usability issues encountered when
working in Virtual Environments (VEs). Specifically we are focusing
on user's primary needs when working with others across
<B><I>Tele-immersive</I> (T-I) </B>networks in collaborative VEs.
This project is an extension of a research project in
Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), CS5743, where we looked
into issues beyond performance which includes the support of
interaction, communication, and collaboration. A major component of
Tele-immersive collaboration is awarness. This is especially true
when participants collaborate in large-scale potentially crowded VEs.
The ability to know where others are in a VE, what they are doing,
and where their attention is focused is crucial to collaborative
interaction. Consequently, a great deal of our effort has been
directed toward supporting collaborative awareness.
