		A Brief Professional BIO
	</div>
	<p class="main">
		During my primary education I changed of school very often. Most of these were 
      		in Barcelona's area of influence but I even studied for a year at Twin Falls 
      		(Idaho, USA) primary school.
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		I studied Telecommunication Engineering at the <a href="http://www.upc.es" target="_blank">UPC</a> 
      		university in Barcelona. I really decided to take that career as, at that 
      		time, it was the only one that had something to do with audio (as a matter 
      		of fact it only had a very dissappointing subject during the fourth year). 
      		The truth is that I had more interesting things to do than concentrate on 
      		my studies like playing music and as a result my university grades are not 
      		very &quot;exciting&quot;.
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		Ever since I was 13, I have taught at different levels. First, it was private 
      		classes (mainly English and technical subjects), then some after-school 
      		academies. But before I left university I started to teach at a Professional 
      		School called ITES. I was in charge of the sound department and taught different 
      		theoretical and practical subjects (like studio recording or live sound 
      		PA). It was quite interesting, the only pity was that the owner of the school 
      		was much more interested in making money than in teaching quality.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		When I finished my studies at university I had to look for a Final Studies project 
      		to do. I was very happy to find an small announcement from Xavier Serra 
      		offering a project on Audio Morphing. Although that project was assigned 
      		to Jordi Bonada (good friend of mine and also member of the MTG), I was 
      		able to start a project to define a textual-based format for describing 
      		music scores and spectral-based instruments. You can learn more of 
		<a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/%7Examat/metrix.htm" target="_blank">METRIX</a>.
	<br/>
	<br/>	
		After that, I decided to go and work in an engineering and consulting company. 
      		REDEX does all kinds of projects related to installations in public buildings 
      		(libraries, theaters and the like). I was in charge of managing projects 
      		which included electrical engineering, communications or air conditioning. 
      		The last project I managed was the building of the new Convention Center 
      		in Barcelona (La Fira de l'Hospitalet). During my last year in REDEX I started 
      		to collaborate again with the MTG.
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		In this second phase with the MTG I worked in the CUIDAD project. The main 
      		goal of the CUIDAD working group (which included partners like IRCAM or 
      		NOKIA) was to influence on the MPEG7 standard for multimedia description. 
      		Our group proposed a description scheme for musical instrument timbre description.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		Then came my work related to the CUIDADO and TABASCO projects and the CLAM framework. 
      		You can learn more about these current projects in &quot;<a href="projects.htm">Projects 
      		and Research</a>&quot; and about my teaching activities in &quot;
		<a href="teaching.htm">Teaching</a>&quot;.
