<p class="main">
	This website has been tested and works right with latest versions of Mozilla both
	in Debian GNU/Linux (Woody).On the latter OS it has also been tested and works right
	with Opera 7.11. It does not work though with Konqueror 2.2.2 as it messes up layers.
<br/>
  	It also works with Internet Explorer and Netscape on Windows but, why would you want to use
  	one of those browsers when you have an excellent FREE (as in speech not as in beer)
  	browser like Mozilla? (http://www.mozilla.org). 
<br/>
<br/>  	
	If you use an older version of these 
  	browsers you might experience some problems with the javascript support. Click 
  	on the &quot;No Layers/No Javascript&quot; link (lower left) to open a framed-version.
