	CLAM is the accronym for C++ Library for Audio and Music, the main project I am currently involved 
  	in.If you want to develop an application in C++ that has something to do with audio and music you
	should definitely <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/clam" target="_blank"> take a look <a> at this framework. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	In Catalan, CLAM means something like &quot;a continuous sound produced 
  	by a group of people so as to show approval or disapproval with a given event.</font></p>
