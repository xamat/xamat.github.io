		This site does not use Flash or any other propietary technology other
		than Javascript, wich can't still be considered a fully free
		and standarized language. Appart from that it uses standard html and css.

		It has been created by me using mainly a text editor and
		ripping as much code as I could (so feel free to do the same).
