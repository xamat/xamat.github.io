	<p class="main">
	What follows is an incomplete list of projects that I was doing at the Music Technology Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, SPAIN, before I moved to Santa Barbara.
    	<br />
	<br />
		First,I was able to finish my Phd. I enrrolled in the &quot;Computer 
      		Science and Digital Communication&quot; PhD organized by the <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es" target="_blank">IUA</a> 
      		and the <a href="http://www.upf.es/dtecn" target="_blank">Technology Department</a> 
      		of the <a href="http://www.upf.es" target="_blank">UPF</a>. Please follow visit my <a href="Thesis/" target="_blank">PhD page </a>
		if you would like to learn more about it.
	<br />
	<br />
		I was (and sort of still am) project manager of a quite ambitious project that is being carried out 
      		at the MTG. We are designing and implementing a cross-platform framework 
      		for developing music and audio applications and related research. After 
      		long discussions we decided the project should be named CLAM (the word has 
      		an attractive combination of meanings in English and Catalan). CLAM is implemented 
      		in C++ and has already been used for a number of interesting applications. 
      		But the best you can do if you happen to be interested on the project is 
      		visit its <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/clam" target="_blank">webpage</a>.CLAM 
      		is related to the <a href="http://www.agnula.org" target="_blank">AGNULA</a> 
      		European project, focused on the release of a Debian and RedHat distribution 
      		to promote the use of <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_blank">Free</a> 
      		music and audio applications.
	<br />
	<br />
		On the other hand, I wasm involved in two other projects: 
		<a href="http://www.semanticaudio.org" target="_blank">SIMAC</a> 
      		and <a href="http://www.s2s2.org" target="_blank">S2S² </a>. <br/>
		SIMAC is a project about semantic interaction with audio content. One of
		the outputs of the project are three prototypes: a tool for annotating 
		audio semi-automatically, a music collection organizer and a recommender.
		I was in charge of leading the developing team.
	<br />
	<br />
	        Finally, I was involved in promoting Free Software.
