		Running
	</div>
    
	<p class=main>
		A couple of years ago, I decided to start running with the goal of sometime running a half-marathon. Now I am completely hooked into running. This year I have run more halfs than I care to count and two full marathons with a personal best of 3:32 and change in Chicago. I can now say that running is an important part of my everyday life. You can follow me on <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/xamat/fitnessReports/running/view">Runkeeper</a> or Strava.

		Cinema
	</div>
    
	<p class=main>
		Following this same line, nowadays I also visit the cinema much less than I wished. 
      		I like classical movies like The Godfather or Citizen Cane but my favourite 
      		films are a bit more &quot;off-mainstream&quot;. I would recommend any film 
      		by Jim Jarmush (including Down by Law or Night On Earth), the first films 
      		by Gus Van Sant (My Own Private Idaho) and some by Kevin Smith (Clerks or 
      		Chasing Amy).

		Reading
	</div>
    	
	<p class=main>
		Although I must admit that nowadays I do it much less than I would like - and when 
      		I do it is mainly to read technichal books - reading is still one of my 
      		favourite activities.
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		I could make a long list of favourite books and authors but I will try to 
      		concentrate on those that most have influenced me. The first book I remember 
      		as having influenced me as a child is Michael Ende's Momo (which I found 
      		much more impressive/depressive than his famous Never-ending Story). I was quite a 
      		lot into J.R.R. Tolkien at that time also. 
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		I really read a lot while I was a child and still did the same as a teenager. 
      		During that age I read some impressive books that I still like: any 
      		book by Boris Vian is highly recommendable, Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller, 
      		most of Garcia Marquez', some of William Burroughs... (when I was 18 I even read
		Joyce's Ulyses and even finished it!).
