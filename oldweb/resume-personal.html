		A Brief Personal Biography
	</div>
	
	<p class="main">
		I met my wife Natalia when I was 18. Three years later we rented a flat and 
      		went to live together. We got married in 1997 and we spent our honeymoon 
      		in Venezuela. We have a son, Aitor, and a daughter, Adriana. Aitor was born 
      		on a very particular date 9-9-99. Adriana was born on April 22nd 2003 so she is
		now about 4 months old.
	<br/>
    	<br/>
		Now we live in La Garriga, a very nice village 40km from Barcelona. It takes 
      		me about an hour to get to my place of work in Barcelona on train.
	<br/>
   	<br/>
		I was born in 1973 in Barcelona. When I was 5, my parents moved to Santa Eulalia 
      		de Ron&ccedil;ana, a littele village 30km from Barcelona where I spent all 
      		my childhood. When I was 6 my father died so after that I lived with my 
      		mother (Esther) and my sister (Est&iacute;baliz).
	<br/>
   	<br/>
		When I was 11 I went to the US to study for a year. I stayed with my uncle, aunt 
      		and cousins who live in Twin Falls, Idaho. When I came back I had almost 
      		forgot all my Spanish and Catalan. But I was also able to get some official 
      		English language titles (like the Profficiency level from the University 
      		of Cambridge) and start teaching english from a very young age (the first 
      		english class I gave was when I was 13). A few years after I started to 
      		give some maths and physics private lessons to students who had difficulties 
      		with those subjects.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		I studied secondary grade (formerly called BUP) in La Vall del Tenes highschool. 
      		I changed to Granollers for my last year before university when I learned 
      		that some teachers were getting a bit tired of my attittude (so was I). 
      		(As a matter of fact the head of my former school tried to talk me out of 
      		studying the career I had chosen at University saying that was too difficult 
      		for someone who liked partying so much).
	<br/>
	<br/>
		During that period of time I also started to play music (see the &quot;
		<a href="#" onmousedown="pageManager('load_page','music.htm')">My Music</a>&quot; section).. 
		I then went on to study Telecommunications Enginneering 
      		to the UPC University in Barcelona. Ever since I have been going to Barcelona 
      		on train every day.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		Like many young people of that age, during my university studies I was not very 
      		much concentrated on studying. I had &quot;more interesting&quot; things 
      		to do at that time like playing in a rock band, playing cards in the university 
      		bar or reading Joyce's Ulysses.
	<br/>
	<br/>	
		Even so, I was able to finnish my studies more or less in time (it took me an 
      		extra year to finnish a couple of subjects) and I started to work even before 
      		I finnished the career.
