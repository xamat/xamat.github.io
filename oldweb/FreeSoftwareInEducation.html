<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">This paper reviews the
suitability of Free Software with particular regard to education. The
characteristics of Free Software and Open Source and their respective
licenses are explained. The pragmatic advantages of Free Software are
outlined, with a focus on technical, economical and business related
issues. It is proposed that the choice of software is not morally
neutral, and that free software is a more coherent choice. The
education specific aspects of Free Software are examined, and
arguments put forward as to why Free Software is the best option for
education and research. Practical guidance is provided on Free
applications which can substitute for proprietary applications.
Finally a four step route map is proposed for individuals or
institutions who wish to move from a proprietary to a Free software
environment.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In this paper we use the term Free Software in the sense
defined by the Free Software Foundation. According to this widely
accepted definition, in order to qualify as Free Software any piece
of software must observe the following four freedoms [FSF-a]:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	<FONT SIZE=2>Freedom 1: Unlimited use for any purpose</FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	<FONT SIZE=2>Freedom 2: Freedom to study and modify it for your own
	needs</FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	<FONT SIZE=2>Freedom 3: Freedom to copy it</FONT></P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
	<FONT SIZE=2>Freedom 4: Freedom to distribute it with any
	modifications.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>It is clear that in this sense &ldquo;free&rdquo; is not
used as meaning &ldquo;no economic cost&rdquo; but rather as granting
specified freedoms to its user. Because of this Free Software is
often referred to as &ldquo;Libre Software&rdquo;, using the Spanish
word &ldquo;libre&rdquo; with its unambiguous meaning. The opposite
of Free Software is Proprietary Software. It is important to stress
that Free Software is not necessarily non-commercial, and that
neither does the absence of payment for use mean that software is
Free in the sense we have defined (for example Microsoft Internet
Explorer). </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Freedom in Free Software is established through
copyright (which in this case is referred to as &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;).
Copyright allows its owner to license the product, and it is in this
license that the four freedoms can be granted and guaranteed. It is
therefore a myth that the Free Software movement is opposed to
copyright and authorship, on the contrary, it is one of the main
goals of the Free Software Foundation to protect software authors and
their copyright.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Hundreds of licenses are available for publishing a
piece of Free software, and there are many others which seem to be
Free but are not, because they do not grant the 4 freedoms defined
above. In case of doubt the Free Software Foundation provide guidance
on whether they consider a particular license to be Free [FSF-b].</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In a broad sense, Free software licenses can be
classified into 3 categories: GPL-like, LGPL-like and BSD-like. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>GPL, the Gnu Public License [FSF-c], provides the
strongest protection both for the author&rsquo;s decision to make the
software Free, and for the freedoms granted. The basic characteristic
of GPL-like licenses is that all derived software or applications
that use the licensed software must use the same license, thus
guaranteeing that all related software will remain Free. Thus GPL
&ldquo;vaccinates&rdquo; software against non-Free usage (although
GPL&rsquo;s detractors choose to describe it as &ldquo;viral&rdquo;).<U>
</U></FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>The LGPL or Lesser GNU Public License is similar to the
GPL but does not protect the software from being used in a
proprietary application. In this sense it provides less protection
for freedom and the author&rsquo;s rights.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally the BSD or Berkeley Source Distribution license
[Berkeley] is the least protective as it allows the licensed code to
be used or derived in any way, be it in Free or in proprietary
software.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0.42cm">
<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><B>Open Source</B></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>The terms Free Software and Open Source are often
misused and confused. Although &ldquo;open source&rdquo; per se
refers only to the fact that the software is distributed with its
original source code available, the term is currently related to the
Open Source Initiative (OSI) that was started in 1998, (see [FSF-d]
and [OSI-a] to see how both organizations compare their initiatives).
The Open Source Initiative advocates abandoning the &ldquo;ideological&rdquo;
issues informing Free Software, and concentrates on the practical
factors that make open source software more reliable from a technical
point of view.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Three people have greatly influenced the discourse
surrounding Free Software, and have served as a focus for the range
of positions taken on the issues: Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, and
Linus Torvald.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Richard Stallman is the founder of GNU and the Free
Software Foundation. In 1983 he initiated the GNU (acronym of GNU&rsquo;s
Not Unix) Project for developing a Free UNIX-like operating system.
In 1985 he defined Free Software described above, and in that same
year he introduced the GPL license.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Eric Raymond is the founder of the Open Source
Initiative. He started the project in 1998 after disagreeing with
Stallman&rsquo;s &ldquo;utopic&rdquo; view on the subject.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, Linus Torvald is probably the most well-known
personality related to Free Software, and is the creator and main
maintainer of the Linux kernel . In 1991 the Linux kernel was
incorporated to the developing GNU system, which still lacked a
kernel, and gave place to the GNU/Linux operating system used by
millions of people around the world. The Linux kernel is licensed
with the GPL license.</FONT></P>

</OL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In this section we review the main practical advantages
of Free Software, leaving the more ethical or social issues for next
section, in which we concentrate on Free Software in education. The
practical advantages can be divided into three broad areas:
technical, economical and business related.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>First, we concentrate on the technical advantages, which
can be summarized as better quality, more security, more stability,
collective ownership and effort, and price. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Free Software can achive higher quality because the code
can be revised by many different programmers with a wide range of
perspectives. As a result the adopted solution will probably be the
best in the technical sense, not being subject to obscure strategic
or business-related issues. Needless to say, releasing a Free
software package by no means guarantees immediate collaboration from
developers, but the opportunity is made explicity, and there is a
natural tendency for useful and well designed packages to attract the
largest developer communities.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Free Software is also more secure. This may not seem
obvious: how can software whose code is completely accessible be
secure? The technical reasons are complex to explain but can be
understood through the &ldquo;key&amp;lock&rdquo; metaphor. Knowing
all the technical details of a lock, and even being able to build
one, does not mean that an existing lock can be opened. The same is
true of cryptographic algorithms and security policies. On the other
hand, having many developers look into the code as potential users
increases the likelihood of that any security holes will be swiftly
identified.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Another widespread misconception regarding Free Software
is that it is less stable than proprietary software. It is certainly
true that many software packages evolve so fast that it is difficult
to keep up to date, but it is entirely up to users to choose if they
want to upgrade to the latest version or not. On the other hand a
piece of Free Software is guaranteed never to disappear. It is very
common for a business to buy proprietary software and then find out
some years later that the original developing company has disappeared
and no support is available. This never happen with Free Software,
because if the original developers are no longer available, another
software company can provide support after looking at the source
code.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>The final technical advantage is cost. While Free
software does not necessarily have to be non-commercial, but in the
In the Free Software model, users pay for services and support. There
are many companies which run successful businesses on this basis, for
example [MySQL], [Trolltech] and [Redhat]. This cost is always easier
to evaluate than that of a closed product which has a license price
corresponding to opaque strategic calculations.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>These technical advantages apply equally to non-Free but
Open Source software, but is often suggested that the Free Software
model is not compatible with general economical interests and
disastrous for technology companies. In the following paragraphs we
will argue that this is not the case.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Firstly, let us examine what makes proprietary software
so prone to favour monopolies. When using a given proprietary tool I
am asking all the people who professionally relate to me and with
whom I have to interchange data or knowledge to use that same tool.
If those people adopt the tool, then a transmission chain rapidly
spreads this requirement, and before long a whole economic sector or
region has to use the same software tool. Frequently this particular
tool only works well with other tools from the same company, and this
intensifies the effect. Eventually the monopoly also extends to
hardware platforms. Furthermore, in many cases the monopoly holders
are foreign companies, so all the money companies and users invest in
software leaves the country or region.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In contrast, Free Software is independent and promotes
equal rights, and all companies are invited to take the source code,
study and sell services related to it. As a result, Free Software
promotes the creation of a local and maintainable software industry,
making markets flexible and adaptable and favouring national economy.
</FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Free Software does not mean the death of the software
industry (see [OSI2003] or [Kenwood2001]). Even at present the
percentage of software engineers whose salary directly depends on the
sale of commercial proprietary software is small. Free software
promotes the model of paying for services rather than licenses, and
so builds on this existing revenue flow. This can be a commercial
model, as is shown by the fact that major companies such as IBM are
already working in this direction.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Although all the pragmatic reasons mentioned so far are
of great importance, others may be of even more significance, and we
will discuss them in the context of education and universities.</FONT></P>

	advantages of free software</B></FONT></P>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Access to software is increasingly a determining factor
in people&rsquo;s ability to communicate, learn, and work. We access
the internet through software, we read, write and study through
software, and when we look for a job we are required to have software
skills. Furthermore, as more and more activity is centred around
software related services, software itself is bound to condition the
vision of the world for our new generations. The &ldquo;windows&rdquo;
paradigm, for instance, has already modified the way we understand
information, the way we think and the way we relate with the world. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>From this perspective, the key issue is who is taking
the decisions which decide the way that coming generations will
understand the world? It seems clear to us that such issues are too
important to be in the hands of a single company with no social
commitment other than maximising shareholder value. Depending on ones
political view of the world two different possible situations may be
identified. In the first vital software such as operating systems, or
internet browsers would be the result of standardization processes
that would at least set the basis or guidelines that could then be
developed by different companies on common grounds. In the second
situation, Free Software would be enforced and no proprietary or
closed solution could be commercialized. We believe that both
situations would at the end be fairly equivalent although our
experience of some standardization processes leads us to think that
the second possibility (enforcing Free Software) may be more
practical and agile, but would also encounter more resistance and
legal issues.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In many ways the values espoused by Free Software also
inform education in democratic societies: freedom of thought and
expression, equal opportunities, community effort and benefit,
without which education becomes indoctrination. A key factor in
learning is access to information, and the state intervenes in this
respect by providing public schools and libraries in most countries.
Today, not only are documents stored as software, but, more
importantly, software provides the main access channel to
information. Moreover, software increasingly provides the environment
within which learning is carried out. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Democracy education institutions have a duty to present
a range of points of view on any given issue, and to promote critical
thought and discussion. In order to respect this plurality one should
avoid promoting the idea that there is only one effective software
solution, and that this solution belongs to a particular company.
There are however more significant underlying issues. Firstly, the
software infrastructure and tools have a significant impact on the
organisation of institutions and the processes which they support,
and consequently they should be under the control of the communities
which use them. Secondly, in universities we aspire to &ldquo;teach
to learn&rdquo;. Proprietary software discourages this because it
withholds information from users, and does not allow them to explore
the potential of the software or to extend it. It may appear that
this argument exaggerates the importance of accessing the source
code, as it may be suggested that only professional software
engineers will be able to really make use of it. There are, however,
many levels of interaction with software, as is shown by those web
authors using proprietary tools who end up editing HTML. Free
software can ensure that appropriate tools are available at all
levels so that users can take control of the environment which they
use. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>The practical advantages described in the previous
section also apply in an educational environment: a school or
university can profit from lower costs, and provide more effective
support for the national or local economy. An additional practical
issue for schools is that important for learners to have the same
software at school and at home. When proprietary software is used,
most students are unwilling or unable to pay for the software and so
they use unauthorised copies. In this way the education system
becomes complicit in the use of illegal software.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, many of the arguments in favour of Free
software can also be applied to Free educational content, and a
number of initiatives have been established which take this approach

<FONT SIZE=2>The scientific method in itself depends to a great
extent in the free exchange of knowledge and ideas. Scientists and
researchers are realizing more and more that current duplication of
effort because of fear of losing intellectual property makes no
sense, and hampering research and scientific progress. In many cases,
however, publishing research results or the algorithm is not enough,
as today the implementation is often an important part of the result.
We need to know whether a particular algorithm can work in different
systems, how it performs in different situations, and its speed in
different implementations. Software can be, and in many cases is,
considered another sort of &ldquo;publication&rdquo;.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In this section we briefly comment on some Free
alternatives to tools which are widely used in education, in order to
demonstrate that Free Software is a viable option. We refer readers
interested in substituting a particular application to the Free
software listings such as that maintained by the GNU project, the
JOIN! project mentioned above, or to simply search the Internet for
&ldquo;Free Software Application X&rdquo;.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Probably the most widely used application in education,
and beyond, is Microsoft Office. This proprietary package is used by
staff, faculty and learners alike. A number of Free applications
exist that substitute particular components in the package. For
instance, Abiword is a solid replacement for Microsoft Word; Gnumeric
can substitute Microsoft Excel quite well;. MagicPoint is a
replacement for Microsoft Powerpoint; and TotalRekall is a reasonable
substitute for Microsoft Access, though rather complicated to install
in its Free version. There is, however, a Free package which
substitutes for the whole of Microsoft Office (except for Access,
included only in Microsoft&rsquo;s Professional edition): OpenOffice
[Community]. This is a complete suite that can be used to edit text
documents, work with spreadsheets or prepare overhead projections.
The package is very robust, stable, and comprehensive and many new
features are planned to be added in the short term. The user
interface is so similar to that in Microsoft Office that the learning
curve for an MS Office user is almost non-existent. Furthermore,
OpenOffice has been translated to a many languages, including some
not available for Microsoft Office. OpenOffice is a cross-platform
application that can be installed in both GNU/Linux and Microsoft
Windows.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Another set of tools of general use, but also important
in education, are the various internet services including web
browsers and e-mail clients. There are many Free tools in this area
but Mozilla is of particular interest. Netscape gave this Free
version to the community and has now announced that the proprietary
version is soon to be discontinued. The Mozilla package includes a
web browser, an e-mail client and a basic webpage editor. The lighter
Firebird version includes only the web browser. The Mozilla web
browser and e-mail client is more secure and technologically advanced
than Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer or Outlook Express.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In scientific or technological education it is very
common to use mathematical packages such as Matlab . Octave is a good
Free substitute which is used in many research institutions, and

<FONT SIZE=2>Two examples of applications which are only available as
Free Software are LaTeX and Emacs. The former is a complete
environment for generating professional quality texts for publishing,
and it includes tools for handling bibliographies or a large
collection of publishing styles. LaTeX is even required by some
international publishing companies when handing in manuscripts. Emacs
is a very well-known tool, developed and maintained by Richard
Stallman. It is a very advanced text editor that has tools for
editing different formats such as LaTeX or html.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>All these tools can be installed in both GNU/Linux and

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-after: avoid">
<FONT SIZE=2>One of the fundamental problems related to the use of
proprietary software is that of file formats, which is probably one
of the main factors in the emergence software monopolies. Although
most Free applications are now capable of opening proprietary formats
(following substantial development effort), nevertheless, when we
send someone a proprietary document (e.g. a Microsoft Word file), we
are telling them to use the same application. Additionally, because
the file format is not known, we cannot be sure of what information
is encoded in it. The file could, for example, be attaching personal
information without our consent. The problem is that in many
important application areas, such as editing formatted text, there
are no standard formats, and this is a need which international
standardization organisations such as ISO could address with
advantage. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>What formats, then, can be used in place of a Microsoft
Word file? A first alternative is an ASCI text file, and although in
a text file all formatting is lost, this is the best format for many
applications. Many people are used to attaching Microsoft Word files
for simple texts that could well be included in the body of the mail
or as a separate text attachment, which is also much smaller.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>If on the other hand, it is important to keep the format
for a text file, one has to decide if it is to be editable. If this
is not necessary then a Free format such as postscript or PDF may be
used (although the latest versions of PDF are not Free). If the text
file is to be editable a good option is html, which is Free and
highly efficient. It is, of course, also possible to use a Free
format related to an application such as Open Office. In this case it
is true that we force receivers to use a particular application that
they may not have, but this is clearly better than using a
proprietary application, as the receiver can download the Free
application.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally if what a Free editable professional format for
publishing is required, LaTeX is the best choice. This should have
been the case, for instance, in the template of this conference, and
offering only a Microsoft Word format has forced this author install
the software specifically to write this paper.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Another area in which formats are important is the
Internet. We have already mentioned that there are many different
Free web browsers, but the truth is that it is not always easy to
browse the internet with some of them. The main reason is that many
web pages do not using standard html code, but rather code extended
with some proprietary additions. This is particularly worrying as
Internet is supposed to promote free access to information and now it
turns out that this information can only be accessed for an
application belonging to a particular company. The case of Macromedia
Flash is also a direct attack on free access to information although
it must be said that there is still no clear Free alternative to it.
hen browsing the Internet we must demand the right to access any web
page through any browser, and punish companies that force the use of
a particular one (usually Microsoft Internet Explorer) by not using
their services.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Although as already mentioned that most of the important
Free applications can be used both in Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux
(and other operating systems as well), if we want to exploit all the
benefits of Free Software we eventually have to move to GNU/Linux.
This operating system is the combination of the Linux kernel (the
minimum part of the operating system that implements the core and
most important functionality) and the GNU project. Although Linux is
usually used as a synonym for the whole operating system we agree
with the GNU project that this is being unfair to the great number of
people that have worked on GNU functionalities that are now a very
important part of the operating system.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>GNU/Linux is a Unix-like operating system that is more
robust, secure, reliable and advanced than Microsoft Windows (which
is why most critical services such as web servers use GNU/Linux).
With modern and configurable GNU/Linux desktops (KDE and GNOME) the
look and feel of the operating system can be very similar to that of
Microsoft Windows.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>One of the main reasons argued by some people not to
install GNU/Linux is that it is very difficult to install, but in
fact modern GNU/Linux installations have complete installers that
make the process very easy. There may be problems caused by hardware
companies who do not support GNU/Linux or provide drivers, but this
situation is usually resolved by an active community which is willing
to invest time to do what should have been done by the companies.
Nevertheless users should be warned that if they use uncommon
hardware they may run into trouble. Once the first installation is
complete, the process of adding new components or applications is at
least as easy as in the Microsoft Windows operating system.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>When one decides to move into GNU/Linux one of the first
problems to faced is which distribution to choose (this is a general
problem with Free Software, as there is so much available that is
difficult to decide on what fits ones personal needs). It is beyond
the scope of this paper to discuss the benefits of each distribution,
but a comprehensive listing is available at Distrowatch
[Distrowatch]. The main ones should, however, be mentioned, which
arguably are: Debian [Debian], Redhat/Fedora [Redhat], and SuSE
[SuSE]. Once an organisation has decided to use GNU/Linux then a
personalized distribution can be prepared. The Extremadura regional
government in Spain, for instance, has promoted the creation of a
specific distribution for public schools [Linex].</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>One easey way to try GNU/Linux is to use a &ldquo;live-CD&rdquo;
such as the Knoppix distribution [Knowppix], which provides a
complete installation of the operating system that can be booted from
a CD, without having to install anything on the hard-drive.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=2>When deciding whether to adopt Free Software for an
institution it should be remembered that this is not an &ldquo;all or
nothing&rdquo; decision. Free Software can be approached carefully in
order to lessen the fear factor. We now propose a route map to go
from an &ldquo;all proprietary&rdquo; to an &ldquo;all Free&rdquo;
situation in small steps that will minimize the sense of sudden
novelty and insecurity. This guidelines are intended to help both
institutions and individuals that are willing to support and use Free

users who ask &ldquo;Will I be able to do everything I can do in my

long answer is there is a Free alternative for almost 100 percent of
proprietary software (excluding games), including of course common
applications such as office suites or internet browsers. In general
terms, the state and features of these alternatives is comparable to
the proprietary applications. Nevertheless, one should recognise that
in some instances certain features and functionality that will have
to be given up. Should this be the case then this must be balanced
against the advantages which we have described above, and the
availability of Free Software of some particular applications which
are not available in proprietary environments.</FONT></P>
