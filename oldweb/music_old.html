<div class="title"> My Music <br>
<br>
What I've done </div>
<p class="main"> Although I started studying music when I was quite
little, I did not take it seriously until I was 15. Then I started to
study piano at the <i>Estudi</i> school of modern music in Granollers.
Although my level at the instrument never got very high, it was quite
enough to enroll in my first band. It was a band created at the same
school and we had a teacher in the rehearsals. With them I did my first
concert. We played four songs (I don't remember all, but one was
Allmand Brothers' and another one was a blues by Sting). <br>
<br>
There were some interesting people in the audience and a few weeks
later the Delbisness band was formed. With this band we only played
covers. To name a few, I remember playing songs by: The Clash (Death or
Glory), Rolling Stones (Dead Flowers), Ramones (Beat on the Brat), The
Kinks (You Really Got Me), Burnin and Los Suaves. We did a few concerts
that were quite "succesfull". <br>
<br>
Some members of that band decided that we wanted to play our own songs.
Carles Lloveras, Xavi Palou, Ramon Valls and I created the Maijalas
band. The idea was to mix rock with more latin rithms (nowadays I know
that is very common). Maijalas got to record a demo tape and a CD. We
broke up when we were preparing our second CD. Here you have a few
samples from our first CD <img src="samples.png"

<div class="title"> What I listen to </div>
<p class="main"> I really like most kinds of music if it is of enough
quality. I think there is a time for everything, so these are my
favourite bands: </p>
<br>
<ul class="main">
  <li> <i>When I need "energy":</i> Violent Femmes, The Smiths, David
Byrne, Goran Bregovic, Bad Religion, Jane's Addiction, RHCP, Plastilina
Mosh, David Bowie or Orchestre Nationale des Barb&eacute;s </li>
  <li> <i>When I feel more "latin":</i> Ruben Blades, Compay Segundo
(or any other from the Buenavista Social Club), Michel Camilo (or any
other from the film Calle 54) </li>
  <li> <i>When I want some "flamenco":</i> Camar&oacute;n, Enrique
Morente, Pata Negra, Ketama (only the old albums), Kiko Veneno,
Martires del Comp&aacute;s, Radio Tarifa </li>
  <li> <i>Something more "melancholic":</i> Van Morrison, Tom Waits,
Neil Young, Thindersticks or Jay Jay Johanson. </li>
  <li> <i>Some other very good spanish or catalan music:</i> Javier
Ruibal, Dusminguet, Radio Futura, Umpah-pah and La Cabra
Mec&aacute;nica. </li>
</ul>
<p class="main"> <b>Latest records I would recommend</b>:
I finally decided to listen to Bebo and Cigala's Lagrimas Negras (I usually
don't like to give a chance to superhits) and I must admit that it
is a great album. I think latest release by Bjork, Medussa, is absolutely
awesome. I also like a lot Wilko's A Ghost is Born. I discovered and liked
a lot another spanish band: Antònia Font. I also liked latest releases by
Fatboy Slim and Enrique Bunbury. Finally I must admit I like Marilyn Manson's
covers in Lest We Forget.

</p>
<p class="main"> <b>Previous recommendations (1)</b>: It has been
such a long time since the last update that I have many many
recommendations to do. I will try to be very brief. My favourites:
Kevin Johansen's Sur o no Sur, Josele Santiago's Las Golondrinas, Mala
Rodriguez' Alevosia, PJ Harvey's Uh Uh Her, Prince's Musicology, The
Street's A Grant Dont Come for Free. I also discovered some new artists
that I have ended up liking quite a lot such as Fito y los Fitipaldis,
The White Stripes, Tory Amos, Ryan Adams, Franz Ferdinand and
especially Adam Green.<br>
<b><br>
Previous recommendations (2)</b>: Relax by Los Piratas (excellent),
Party Songs by Se&ntilde;or Coconut (funny as hell latin versions of
classics like Smoke on The Water), Strays by Jane's Addiction (yeah, I
know it is not Ritual de lo Habitual but it has great songs), Actos
Inexplicables by Nacho Vegas (extremely surprising), and Sleeping With
Ghosts by Placebo (I like those guitars). Some more polemical
recommendations (because they are top-selling albums) are The Eminem
Show by Eminem (really, I had never heard any lyrics to be so crude,
realistic and straight: I don't know of any artist that would dare
write what is in 'Cleaning Out My Closet', for instance), and Jarabe de
Palo has an excellent song, 'Cambia la piel', in an awful album. <br>
<br>
<b>Previous recommendations(3)</b>: Flamingos by Enrique Bunbury and The
Moldy Peaches' Greatest Hits. </p>
