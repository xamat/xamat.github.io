MET++

<P>
MET++ (Multimedia ET++) is general compositional environment for multimedia
with interactive editing facilities in which multimedia presentations
are regarded as a hierarchical composition of time objects. MET ++
was developed at the University of Zurich by Philip Ackermann [<A
 HREF="node207.html#AckermannMETICMC">Ackermann, 1994a</A>].
It was published and distributed as Free Software in 1996 but no updates
have been added since then as the author joined a startup company
shortly after and discontinued its support<A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot1042"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A>. Nevertheless, the framework has been used for several developments
and it is a reference for multimedia software design.

<P>
Much of its impact is due to the fact that the media framework is
based on the ET++ framework written in C++ also developed at the Univ.
of Zurich. ET++[<A
 HREF="node207.html#WeinandET++89">Weinand et&nbsp;al., 1989</A>] is an OO framework that integrates
user interface building blocks, basic data structures, support for
object input/output, printing, and high-level application framework
components. ET++ is a classical reference in OO literature for being
a test-bed for software engineering practices such as design patterns
and refactoring. To the already existing support for 2D objects present
in ET++, MET++ added support for 3D graphical objects, camera objects,
and audio and music object.

<P>
MET++ is an object-oriented application framework that addresses the
main difficulties that can be encountered when designing applications
for multimedia authoring or editing, namely: integration of several
media types with different real-time constraints at low-level device
interfaces; support for media compositions to define high-level inter-media
synchronization and real-time control; intuitive user interface interactions
with direct manipulations of graphical representations and high semantic
feedback; and flexibility and portability for different hardware configurations
and platforms.

<P>
Although the main development platform of MET++ was a Silicon Graphics
Indigo workstation, the framework is cross-platform and hardware dependencies
are hidden in a portability layer that provides abstract interfaces
to operating system, windows system, as well as audio and MIDI input/output.

<P>
Perhaps the most important aspect in the framework is the way it handles
time synchronization [<A
 HREF="node207.html#AckermannMET++Time">Ackermann, 1994b</A>]. The temporal information
is represented through a hierarchical composition that includes information
about part-of relations, grouping, and temporal constraints and allows
automatic time calculation. The components in the structure are modelled
as time events that have their own starting point, duration and virtual
line. The base class of the time dependent objects is the <TT>TEvent</TT>.
The high-level synchronization accuracy is based on milliseconds time
resolution. In a multimedia presentation temporal relationships are
configured by composing several universal time objects such as <TT>TSequence</TT>,
<TT>TimeLine</TT>, <TT>TSynchro</TT>, <TT>TShift</TT> and <TT>TLoop</TT>
with special media objects. Any time dependent object inherited from
TEvent can be inserted into the composition.

<P>
The time dynamic behavior of a time wrapper is supported through time
functions expressing actions such as fading, scaling or positioning.
A time function can manipulate the time itself so that every object
can have its local time. In real-time presentations there is usually
a <TT>Conductor</TT> object that periodically sends <TT>Perform</TT>
messages to the time dependent objects in the hierarchy. Media objects
compute only the necessary data for the next interval. Continuous
media data is computed incrementally ahead into a buffer. Interactions
such as fast-forward or slow-motion are realized by changing the parameters
of the <TT>Perform</TT> message: start time, presentation duration
and real-time duration (the behavior of the media objects depend on
the way they respond to the relation between these two).

<P>
The <TT>Intensity</TT> class is used for representing values for amplitude,
gain, volume... It can operate and convert itself to byte, integer,
floating-point, decibel and MIDI value. The <TT>Pitch</TT> class is
able to handle information about pitch key and frequency. It uses
the Tonal System to map symbolic keys to Hz. The <TT>Beat</TT> class
models beat and bar properties and delegates quantization and the
mapping from symbolic beat measure to physical seconds to the <TT>MusicalContext</TT>
class. The <TT>PitchScale</TT> class can represent symbolic scales
(chromatic, dorian...) or physical intervals for tuning purposes.

<P>
Audio resources are modelled with the abstract <TT>AudioUnit</TT>
class as modules of a source-filter-sink architecture. The output
of an <TT>AudioUnit</TT> can be sent to another <TT>AudioUnit</TT>
and define an audio signal flow graph. Audio files can be played in
real-time from disk or converted to a Sound object.

<P>
The interpretation of a musical performance is modelled in the time-dependent
<TT>MusicalContext</TT> class. It holds information about the tonal
system, tonality, signature, measure, and tempo. The <TT>MusicPlayer</TT>
interprets its notes in the context and delegates the note playing
to the abstract <TT>MusicInstrument</TT> class. The concrete
classes <TT>MIDIInstrument</TT>, <TT>CSoundInstrument</TT>, and <TT>Synthesizer</TT>
(allocates Oscillators) map the note representation to device specific
synthesis parameters.
