The development team</A>
</H2>

<P>
In order to understand what CLAM has become it is important to understand
how the development team has evolved over time since its initial configuration.
Although in order to better understand the roles we will sometimes
mention the main contributions of some collaborators it is important
to understand that CLAM has always adopted a policy contrary to ``code
ownership''. Therefore it is difficult to say that any one is exclusively
responsible for one part of the framework.

<P>
Although CLAM's development team (clam-devel for short) has evolved
over time it has always had an average of 5 developers. It must be
pointed out though that, because of our situation inside an educational
institution, it is seldom the case that a developer can dedicate full-time
to CLAM, having other responsibilities related to other projects or
to teaching/attending classes.

<P>
Only two members of the current development team (the author of this
thesis and Maarten de Boer) were present in the initial team. Apart
from developing many different components of the framework the author
of this thesis has been responsible since then of coordinating and
managing the team as well as designing the general working guidelines.
Maarten de Boer has also contributed in many different parts of the
framework but has been the main responsible for most of the Audio
and MIDI input/output infrastructure as well as the build system. 

<P>
This initial team had also three other members, (Emilia G&#243;mez, Fabien
Gouyon, and Joachim Haas) that did not have at that time many programming
skills and were rather in charge of implementing signal processing
algorithms. The first design decisions were basically taken by Maarten
de Boer and the author but taking into account inputs from other researchers
in the MTG, especially Jordi Bonada who is the developer of the original
SMSTools.

<P>
The three original non-programmer members were soon replaced by new
comers with their focus turning more into their research interests.
The next three members of the CLAM development team were Pau Arumi,
David Garcia and Enrique Robledo. Out of these three, the first two
were interested in developing CLAM as part of their Master Thesis
and they are still, at the time of this writing, members of the clam-devel
team. Pau Arumi developed Dynamic Types and other low-level CLAM infrastructure
for his Master Thesis while David Garcia was responsible for the XML
infrastructure. Both of them have been involved in many different
development issues since then. Enrique Robledo also contributed on
the general infrastructure, especially in Processing and flow control,
and developed the first real-time robust CLAM application called Rappid
(see <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>). Soon after another student, Miguel
Ramirez, also came to do his Master Thesis in the context of the CLAM
framework. He was the main responsible for the design of the Visualization
Module and he is still an active member of the development team with
contributions in many other different areas of the framework.

<P>
Other students have contributed to the framework, especially because
of their Master Thesis. Out of these the ones that have at some time
been part of the clam-devel team are the following: Xavier Rubio,
who contributed on the development of the automatic flow and the Network
Editor; Albert Mora, who contributed on the development of the SMSTools
graphical interface; Merlinj Blaaw, who was in charge of developing
the CLAM interface for developing VST plugins and also improved some
efficiency issues; and Ismael Mosquera, who developed a voice to MIDI
conversor and is currently in charge of graphical user interface issues.
