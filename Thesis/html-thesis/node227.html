The build system</A>
</H2>

<P>
CLAM provides a quite automated Build System that allows to generate
and maintain, with little effort, GNU Makefiles and VisualC++ project
files to build large volumes of source files. Note that this build
system is specialized on building CLAM distribution binaries and CLAM
based applications and although it could be surely be adapted to other
kind of projects it has not been used outside the framework.

<P>
In any project it is difficult to deal with a complex source files
dependency graph. Without a build system helper you have to add by
hand each .cxx file into the Project IDE or build script in order
to compile it. CLAM Build System is able to do this task with little
supervision: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">srcdeps</SPAN> is a small and smart application that
is able to deduce the source files that need to be compiled following
the following simple rule:

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If main.cxx must be compiled and includes both blue.hxx
and green.hxx

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then blue.cxx and green.cxx must be also compiled'

<P>
This rule to is based on the hypothesis that for each header named
Foo.hxx a Foo.cxx file exists somewhere, a thing that may or may not
be true. Also there can be additional .cxx not related to any .hxx
that should be compiled. In both cases, you can provide additional
starting points to look for dependencies. 

<P>
The CLAM build system is designed to be used to build CLAM examples,
libraries and tests that are inside the CLAM source tree. But it also
provides facilities to anybody building their own applications with
CLAM. In order to use CLAM internal build system for building your
App you must consider the source tree structure suggested in the documentation
and use the following configuration files: defaults.cfg, settings.cfg,
clam-location.cfg, system.cfg, and system-win.cfg or system-linux.cfg.
Out of these, three need to be edited: the particular path to clam
must be introduced into clam-location.cfg, the default global configuration
variables must be edited into defaults.cfg and the settings related
to the particular project must be entered into settings.cfg.

<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5221">There are two main kinds of config variables depending
on the values they may take: Boolean variables - these can only have
values of 0 or 1. Usually 0 means that the variable effect is disabled,
and 1 that it is enabled; and Textual variables - they are a string,
for instance, a relative path to some file. Also depending on the
effect, there are three kinds of variables: Build System variables
- variables whose value just affects the CLAM build system behavior
while naming binaries or searching for certain files; External Libraries
variables - variables whose value determines whether the build system
will make your application link or not to some ( or any ) of CLAM
external libraries; and CLAM internal variables - these variables
are mainly compile-time flags that activate/deactivate certain framework
features or change some framework behavior. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5223">Build system variables reference include the following:</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5225">TOP (Textual) - Should contain the relative path
from the settings.cfg file to the 'top' of the project source tree </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5227">PROGRAM (Textual) - Should contain the name for
the program binary </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5821">PRJ_SEARCH_INCLUDES (Textual) - Should contain
the lists relative paths, from settings.cfg location, to folders where
you want srcdeps to look for binary dependencies, usually the folders
where you have your sources. Note that srcdeps *will not* perform
a recursively descent search on these folders. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5822">PRJ_SEARCH_RECURSE_INCLUDES (Textual) - Should
contain the list relative paths, from settings.cfg location, to folders
where you want srcdeps to look for binary dependencies, usually the
folders where you have your sources. Note that srcdeps *will*
perform a recursively descent search on these folders. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5235">SOURCES (Textual) - Should contain the source file
that contains the application entry point. While building library
binaries or not following for some reason the rule 'for each header
file there exists a source file with the same name' then you should
add the source relative paths, from current settings.cfg location. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5237">CLAM configuration variables include: </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5239">CLAM_DOUBLE(Boolean) - This variable controls whether
CLAM::TData datatype is either a single precision floating-point number
( ANSI C++ float type ) or a double precision floating-point number
( ANSI C++ double type ). </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5241">CLAM_USE_XML(Boolean) - This variable controls
whether CLAM code is built with XML-based Object External Storage
support. Disabling it could improve compiling speed as well as reduce
code size. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5243">CLAM_DISABLE_CHECKS(Boolean) - This variable controls
whether CLAM internal precondition, postcondition and invariant verification
checks are performed or not. Deactivating it could improve code speed
in spite of robustness. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5823">CLAM_USE_RELEASE_ASSERTS(Boolean) - This variable
controls whether CLAM Asserts behave equally in &#34;debug&#34;
and &#34;not debug&#34; mode. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5250">And finally external libraries variables are:</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5252">USE_ALSA(Boolean) - Tells the build system to make
applications to link against ALSA. Note that this variable can only
have effect on GNU/Linux systems. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5254">USE_FFTW(Boolean) - Tells the build system to make
applications to link against the FFTW library. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5256">USE_FLTK(Boolean) - Tells the build system to make
applications to link against FLTK. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5258">USE_DIRECTX(Boolean) - Tells the build system to
make applications to link against DirectX SDK. Note that this variable
only has effect on Microsoft Windows(c) systems. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5260">USE_PORTMIDI(Boolean) - Tells the build system
to make applications to link against Portmidi. Note that this variable
only has effect on Microsoft Windows(c) systems. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5262">USE_RTAUDIO(Boolean) - Tells the build system to
make applications to link against RtAudio. Note that this variable
only has effect on Microsoft Windows(c) systems. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5264">USE_PTHREADS(Boolean) - Tells the build system
to make applications to link against pthreads (POSIX threads library).
Note that this variable only has effect on Microsoft Windows(c) systems. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5266">USE_QT(Boolean) - Tells the build system to make
applications to link against Qt Toolkit. </SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN ID="hue5268">USE_CPPUNIT(Boolean) - Tells the build system to
make applications to link against cppUnit library. </SPAN>
