CLAM as an Audio Processing Framework</A>
</H3>

<P>
In the previous paragraphs we have seen that CLAM presents substantial
differences in respect to some other environments approaches. Nevertheless,
all those compared environments are not in the same category (General
Purpose Audio Processing Framework) than CLAM so these differences
may in some sense be justified. The previous comparison has been useful
to justify CLAM's overall approach. 

<P>
We will now justify its detailed approach and some design decisions
by commenting on the main conceptual similarities and differences
that CLAM presents in respect to the different environments in its
subcategory. These are: the Create Signal Library (CSL), Open Sound
World (OSW), Synthesis ToolKit (STK), Aura, SndObj, FORMES and the
NeXT Sound Kit. We will leave the last two out of the general comparison
only including them when necessary. Both FORMES and the NeXT are no
longer in use, have just been included for historical completeness
and particularly the latter has a slightly different focus aiming
at providing operating system level audio tools.

<P>
Let us first comment what are the main similarities between these
frameworks and CLAM. It is important to highlight that most of the
frameworks in this category have goals very similar to CLAM, particularly
STK, CSL, SndObj and FORMES explicitly recognize subsets of CLAM's
goals as exposed in section <A HREF="node93.html#sec:CLAM::Introduction">3.1</A>. In this
sense, for instance, it is interesting to note that all of them are
implemented in C++ and aim at being cross-platform (although some
of them have still reached this goal). They are also all open source
although this assertion is redundant for a framework as you always
need the source code to build and extend applications.

<P>
In a more conceptual ground, all of them are also object-oriented
and offer some sort of graph-based model in which processes are nodes
of the graph. The concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing objects</SPAN> in CLAM has
more or less direct equivalents in all of them: they are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unit
generators</SPAN> in CSL, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transforms</SPAN> in OSW, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN> in
STK, either <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unit generators</SPAN> in Aura, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sound objects</SPAN> in
SndObj, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">processes</SPAN> in FORMES. Note that this concept is
not exclusive of this category of environments but is rather an idea
that is repeated in many other environments (they are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transformations</SPAN>
in Marsyas, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transforms</SPAN> in Kyma, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">objects</SPAN> in Max, or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">EventGenerators</SPAN>
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">EventModifiers</SPAN> in Mode).

<P>
In all of these frameworks, the ``processing objects'' are connected
in some way in order to build a more complex ``network'' that
conforms the base of a given application. As mentioned in this section
CLAM offers two different mechanisms for composing with processing
objects. If the composition is static we call the result a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing
Composite Object</SPAN> while if it is dynamic we call it <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing
Network</SPAN>. In many aspects CLAM's Processing Composites are equivalent
to Aura's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN> or FORMES' relation between parent and
children processes while CLAM Processing Networks are like CSL's,
OSW's or Max's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patches</SPAN>.

<P>
We will now comment the main differences that CLAM presents in respect
to these same frameworks. As a general difference, it must be noted
that all of them have followed a development process that differs
from CLAM's. As a matter of fact, all of them can be considered &#34;one-man-systems&#34;,
they have been thought out, designed and even developed by one or
two people: CSL by Stephen Travis Pope, Open Sound World by Amar Chaudray,
STK by Perry Cook and Gary Scavone, Aura by Roger Dannenberg and Eli
Brandt, SndObj by Victor Lazzarini, FORMES by Xavier Rodet and Pierre
Conte and the NEXT Sound Kit by M. Lentezner. None of them has had
such a large development team as CLAM's (see annex <A HREF="node208.html#cha:CLAM-Additional-Information">A</A>
for more practical information on this issue).

<P>
But most importantly, none of them has a defined or explicit policy
of acknowledging and adding user feedback into the development life
cycle. Moreover, none of them declares having a truly incremental
or agile process methodology and the number of releases of the frameworks
are much less frequent than in CLAM.

<P>
The CSL library (see <A HREF="node67.html#sub:CSL">2.3.3</A>) is still not mature enough and
as the authors recognize their experience with the C++ programming
language is rather limited and the framework needs further design
refactorings [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeCSL">Pope and Ramakrishnan, 2003</A>]. On the other hand although CSL is clearly
object-oriented and presents a clean design, the graphical model of
computation is not explicit and ends-up being a bit confusing.

<P>
Open Sound World (see <A HREF="node64.html#sub:Open-Sound-World">2.3.2</A>) is, out of all
these frameworks, the one that probably presents a cleaner and most
mature design. It is clearly object-oriented and the graphical model
of computation is clearly stated. It is efficient and offers many
tools. Nevertheless, it has some differences with CLAM that should
be noted. OSW goal is not to become an application framework but rather
to offer a music composition tool ala Max. Therefore by aiming at
being at artistic/creative tool, its focus is clearly not that of
CLAM, which is to offer a research/development environment. On the
other hand, OSW is mostly a ``one-man system'' and is therefore
mostly synthesis-oriented. This developer is no longer working on
the framework and although some other people work on it, it is not
very active nor updated regularly.

<P>
Although the Synthesis Toolkit or STK (see <A HREF="node63.html#sub:STK">2.3.2</A>) is also
a ``one-man system'' (or more exactly ``two-men'') it has
a long history and it is still updated and maintained on a regular
basis. Nevertheless, it presents a fundamental difference with CLAM
in being clearly synthesis-oriented. STK offers very few tools for
audio or music analysis. Another difference is that in STK there is
no clear distinction between process and data, this is possibly a
feasible decision for a synthesis-only application but not so if data
can be the result of a previous analysis process.

<P>
The Aura framework (see <A HREF="node65.html#sub:W_Aura">2.3.2</A>) is Free Software and is
available from the author. Nevertheless, at the time of this writing
Aura does still not have a publicly supported version because of lack
of documentation and because of its steep learning curve. In its current
state it is not truly cross-platform as it is only being developed
and tested on the Windows platform. Aura aims at offering an efficient
real-time implementation, not only for audio but for general real-time
applications. Because of this the framework sometimes compromises
the understandability and easiness of use of the model. Other practical
differences are that Aura only operates on fixed size data chunks
of audio (it would be difficult to integrate other data such as spectrums)
and there is no clear distinction between control and signal data.

<P>
Finally, SndObj (see <A HREF="node68.html#sub:SndObj">2.3.3</A>) is not a very mature framework
and does not offer many tools or examples. This is so because SndObj
is the most clear example of an strictly speaking ``one-man system''.
SndObj is object-oriented and graph-based but its model is not very
clear. On the other hand it does not focus on efficiency issues and
it is not likely to work on complex real-time situations.
