Instruments and Generators</A>
</H3>

<P>
An Instrument is the class that holds behavior and state for a system
made up of a set of Generators and the relations that are established
in between them. When we define a new Instrument in MetriX we are
actually subclassing the base (and abstract) <TT>Instrument</TT> class
in order to implement behavior that is particular to the Instrument
being defined. This subclassifying though can be done at the object
level by instantiating an object and using some attributes to set
its behavior (It is well known that instantiation is as a matter of
fact a form of subclassification, see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#GrahamOOMethods">Graham, 1991</A>] for
instance).

<P>
Defining an Instrument behavior means specifying how the Instrument
will respond to incoming messages. For doing so we must define what
Generators make up the Instrument and how each of them responds to
input messages.

<P>
In order to produce sound an Instrument needs audio generation primitives
that can be existing audio waves, analysis results or a set of simple
functions such as oscillators or waveform Generators. There is no
need to have one of such primitives for every Generator in the Instrument,
only those needed to represent the space of possible sound combinations
to be produced by the different Generators.

<P>
Therefore, the primitives in MetriX are arranged in what we call the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Timbre Space</SPAN>. The idea of a timbre space is not new (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#WesselTimbreSpace">Wessel, 1979</A>],
for example) but it has specific properties in our framework. A MetriX
timbre space is an n-dimensional space constructed by placing the
audio generation primitives. Each of the dimensions in the space represents
a key feature of the sound such as Pitch or Loudness<A NAME="tex2html97"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5709"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>. The decisions as to how many and which key features are necessary
for a given Instrument is dependent on the flexibility and quality
the sound designer wants the Instrument to have. As it will be seen
later, axes not represented in the timbre space but needed in the
synthesis can also be obtained by transformation. 

<P>
The n-dimensional geometric space is constructed by placing the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">samples</SPAN>
or primitives in precise coordinates belonging to this space. Samples
located at furthest positions in relation to a given dimension define
the limits of the timbre space. Once existing samples are located
at definite positions, intermediate samples can be then obtained by
interpolating neighboring ones.

<P>
A first simple example of a timbre space could be a one dimensional
space formed by placing samples on a single axis, sorted by pitch.
Notes with intermediate pitch will then be obtained by interpolating
the two neighboring samples with the appropriate weight factor.

<P>
Adding some complexity to the example we could add a second dimension
to our timbre space: loudness. Figure <A HREF="#fig:Two-dimensional-timbre">6.9</A>
illustrates a two-dimensional timbre space. Note that only A's in
two different loudness (fortissimo and pianissimo) have been sampled
from the original Instrument. Intermediate pitches and loudness will
be obtained by interpolating existing samples.
