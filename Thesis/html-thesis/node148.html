Processing Composites</A>
</H3>

<P>
A Processing Composite is a static composition of DSPOOM Processing
objects. A Processing Composite is manually implemented by a developer
and might be fine-tuned for efficiency reasons. But the list of included
Processing objects and their connections may not be modified at run-time<A NAME="tex2html52"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2992"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A>. It is a direct implementation of the Composite pattern as defined
in the Gang of Four catalog [<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>].

<P>
A Processing Composite object has one parent that acts as the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">composite</SPAN>
and any number of children that act as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">components</SPAN>. Any child
can in turn be the parent of other Processing objects recursively
defining different levels of composition. A Processing Composite object
is seen as a regular Processing object from the outside, even in a
Network-like context. Therefore, and as it happens in the classical
composite pattern, performing an operation on the Processing Composite
means performing it in all its children recursively to the lowest
level. Particularly:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Constructing a Processing Composite means constructing all its children.
</LI>
<LI>Configuring a Processing Composite means configuring all its children.
</LI>
<LI>Starting or stopping a Processing Composite means starting or stopping
all its children.
</LI>
<LI>Executing a Processing Composite means executing all its children.
</LI>
</UL>
The ``construction condition'' implies that the most usual way
to construct a Processing Composite is by having its children as regular
member attributes. These attributes will be constructed in their parent
construction, they will be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">attached</SPAN> to the children list, and
they will be notified of whom the parent is at that time.

<P>
The ``configuration condition'' means that a Processing Composite
has to offer a configuration that at least contains a subset of all
the configuration parameters in the children. The process of creating
a composite configuration cannot be automated and depends on design
decisions. The Processing Composite class developer has to choose
what parameters will be promoted from the children to the parent layer
of composition. This list of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">published</SPAN> configuration parameters
will define the subset of all parameters that will be available for
the user. It is important to note that in many situations, children
Processing objects share common configuration parameters or have parameters
with coupled semantics. For instance, all children Processing objects
in a Processing Composite may have a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">SamplingRate</SPAN> attribute
that needs to be consistent. Even in that same Processing Composite
we may have a spectral domain Processing object that has a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">SpectralRange</SPAN>
parameter that, although not equivalent, is directly coupled to the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">SamplingRate</SPAN>. Because of all of this it is not a good idea
to simply build the composed configuration by aggregating individual
children configurations.

<P>
The ``start/stop condition'' does not imply any complex control
issues and can be easily automated.

<P>
And finally the ``execution condition'' is where all the flow
control issues have to be solved. No automation can be offered at
this level and it is the designer's responsibility to choose in what
order the children will be executed or how intermediate data will
be handled. On the other hand, in reward for this complexity the Processing
Composite designer is in the position to optimize and fine-tune all
execution and control issues that could not be addressed in a generic
environment such as a Network (see below).
