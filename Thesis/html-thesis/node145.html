Processing Data and Controls</A>
</H3>

<P>
At this point it may still not be completely clear how we can decide
in a particular model if some data should be modeled as Processing
Data or a Control. There are several issues though that can illustrate
the existing difference between Processing Data Objects and Controls.

<P>
To start with, Controls are simple data types such as integers, floats
or boolean. Any structure more complex than that cannot be sent as
a Control. This feature may be seen as a limitation of the metamodel
but it is in fact a feature. It is important to bear in mind that
controls are sent asynchronously whenever they generate or are modified.
The control associated to a slider, for instance, can be transmitted
several times before actually affecting the result of the process,
which will happen next time that the Processing Do is called. It would
be a waste of resources to transmit complex structures with this mechanism.
