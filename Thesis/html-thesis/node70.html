The NeXT Sound Kit
</H3>

<P>
The NeXT computer offered a complete system for manipulating sound
and music divided in two ``kits'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#JeffeNeXTMusicKit">Jaffe and Boynton, 1991</A>]. The
Sound Kit provided object-oriented access to the basic sound capabilities
of the NeXT computer, allowing sound recording, playback, display
and editing. The Music Kit provided classes for composing, storing,
performing and synthesizing music. It allowed the communication with
external synthesizers or the creation of internal software synthesizers.

<P>
Both kits were implemented in objective-C. They were mostly independent
but could also be used together. The Sound Kit, for instance, could
be used to record sound that could then be used in a Music Kit performance. 

<P>
Although NeXT computers were discontinued after the company was bought
by Apple the current Macintosh operating system, OsX, borrows many
ideas from NeXTStep and it includes some toolkits such as Core Audio
that can be considered as successors of NeXT's initiatives. On the
other hand, the Music Kit is still maintained. We will now explain
the Sound Kit and leave the Music Kit for the next section on music-oriented
environments (see <A HREF="node72.html#sub:NeXT-Music-Kit">2.4</A>). 

<P>
The most important class in the Sound Kit is the <TT>Sound</TT> class.
It offers an Objective-C wrapper around the data structure that contains
raw sound data. <TT>Sound</TT> objects can be instantiated from a
sound file, or from the pasteboard, or can be created empty for recording. 

<P>
The Sound Kit makes extensive use of the virtual memory and interprocess
message passing provided by the Mach operating system allowing for
efficient manipulation of large sounds. Sound data is rarely moved,
is rather mapped into virtual memory. Copying operations employ ``copy
on write''. Reading from a sound file is instantaneous, the data
is not brought in from disk until they are required by the application.
For storing a sound the Sound Kit uses a file format provided by NeXT.
This format lets applications share data.

<P>
Playback and recording are performed asynchronously by background
threads. The <TT>Sound</TT> class can contain DSP code to be synthesized
instead of data, its use is transparent. 

<P>
Finally, the <TT>SoundView</TT> class provides a mechanism for displaying
data in a single Sound object.
