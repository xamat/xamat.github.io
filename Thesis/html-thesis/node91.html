Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we have presented a thorough overview of audio and
music processing environments. Although all of them have different
scopes and motivations, we have presented a classification in different
categories. These categories are summarized in the following list:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">General purpose signal processing and multimedia frameworks</SPAN>:
software frameworks for manipulating signals or multimedia components
in a generic way. The most important examples in this category are
<SPAN ID="txt1696">Ptolemy</SPAN> and <SPAN ID="txt1697">ET++</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Audio processing frameworks</SPAN>: software frameworks that offer
tools and practices that are particularized to the audio domain.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Analysis Oriented</SPAN>: Audio processing frameworks that focus on
the extraction of data and descriptors from an input signal. <SPAN ID="txt1701">Marsyas</SPAN>
is the most important framework analyzed in this subcategory.
</LI>
<LI>Synthesis Oriented: Audio processing frameworks that focus on generating
output audio from input control signals or scores. Here it is important
to mention <SPAN ID="txt1702">STK</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI>General Purpose: General purpose Audio processing frameworks offer
tools both for analysis and synthesis. Out of the ones presented in
this subcategory both <SPAN ID="txt1703">SndObj</SPAN> and <SPAN ID="txt1704">CSL</SPAN> are in
a similar position, having in any case some advantages and disadvantages
but no being very mature.
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Music processing frameworks</SPAN>: These are software frameworks
that instead of focusing on signal-level processing applications they
focus more on the manipulation of symbolic data related to music.
<SPAN ID="txt1707">Siren</SPAN> is probably the most prominent example in this category.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Audio and Music visual languages and applications</SPAN>: Some environments
base most of their tools around a graphical metaphor that they offer
as an interface with the end user. In this section we include important
examples such as the <SPAN ID="txt1709">Max</SPAN> family or <SPAN ID="txt1710">Kyma</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Music languages</SPAN>: In this category we present different languages
that can be used to express musical information. We have excluded
those having a graphical metaphor, which are already in the previous
category.

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">N-Music languages</SPAN>: Music-N languages base their proposal on
the separation of musical information into statical information about
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN> and dynamic information about the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">score</SPAN>,
understanding this score as a sequence of time-ordered note events.
Music-N languages are also based on the concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unit generator</SPAN>.
The most important language included in this section, because of its
acceptance, is <SPAN ID="txt1717">CSound</SPAN>.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Score languages</SPAN>: These languages are simply ways of expressing
information in a musical score, usually based on a textual or readable
format. 
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</OL>
As a conclusion we must observe that many different environments exist
and as already commented most of them with different goals, motivations
and scope. Many of these environments are the result of a single person's
effort and therefore offer a very personal view on music or audio
processing. Few of them can truly qualify as software frameworks as
defined in section <A HREF="node23.html#sec:Frameworks">1.3</A> and also very few employ
software engineering methodologies or advanced programming techniques.

<P>
On the other hand, a few of them (namely Max/Pd and CSound) have been
able to build a relatively important community of users that is constantly
adding new features to these environments and may be seen as an added
value.

<P>
The basis that we have set in our analysis of the state of the art
for our particular domain will be used for both constructing our proposals
and also comparing the final results. In particular, in section <A HREF="node130.html#sec:IsCLAMDifferent">3.3</A>
we will compare our CLAM framework to many of these environments.
