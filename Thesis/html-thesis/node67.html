The Create Signal Library (CSL) 
</H3>

<P>
The Create Signal Library (CSL) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeCSL">Pope and Ramakrishnan, 2003</A>], pronounced ``Sizzle'',
is a general purpose C++ library for digital audio processing mainly
designed by Stephen Travis Pope, also author of the Mode and Siren
frameworks (see section <A HREF="node73.html#sub:MODE-and-Siren">2.4</A>). The first implementation
dates back to 1998 when it was called the CREATE Oscillator or CO.
But the current implementation was started by students in 2002. CSL
has been used to build stand-alone applications, interactive installations,
MIDI instruments, and light-weight plug-ins.

<P>
CSL programs are written in standard C++ and linked against the library.
CSL has no graphical interface but GUIs are expected to be built for
manipulating patches. CSL is not a music representation language rather
it is a low-level signal processing and synthesis engine. 

<P>
CSL works on Linux, Unix (Solaris, Iris, OpenBSD), and MacOSX. Windows
is supported but some features (such as abstraction for network and
threads) are missing .

<P>
CSL applications can be controlled via Siren (see <A HREF="node73.html#sub:MODE-and-Siren">2.4</A>)
or MIDI messages. CSL has no scheduler, it simply responds to incoming
control messages as fast as it can. CSL has no notion of time but
unit generators may have state.

<P>
The goals of the CSL project can be summarized in the framework being
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">a scalable</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">portable</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">flexible</SPAN> network-driven
sound synthesis package . By scalable, the author means ``orchestrascalable'':
large groups of instruments with complex synthesis models. This scalability
will be accomplished by running clusters of CSL-based synthesis and
processing server programs on many computers connected by a fast LAN.
Portable means that the software must not depend on any hardware platform
or operating system. It is written in standard C++ and uses hardware
abstraction classes for I/O ports, network interfaces and thread APIs.
Flexible means that the library should support several techniques
of sound synthesis or processing and also be useful for embedding
in other applications.

<P>
In a CSL program there are C++ objects called ``unit generators''.
They can be connected using C++ variables representing their inputs
and outputs. In order to connect an object A to the input of object
B a simple method must be called: B.root(A). The scheduling is done
by pull. The output device asks for samples and this request is propagated.

<P>
The CSL library consists of several components: (1) The object framework
for the synthesis/processing engine; (2) The unit generator class
library; (3) The start-up, configuration and system save/restore facilities;
(4) The OSC control interfaces; (5) The database interface for sound
samples and spectra; (6) The CRAM interface for managing multiple
CSL instances over a network.

<P>
The OO domain model consists of abstractions for objects that create
or process blocks of samples (Buffer, FrameStream, SampleStream, Processor...);
objects representing control variables (StaticVariable, DymanicVariable...);
objects that connect to I/O driver (<TT>IO</TT> and its subclasses);
and objects that help manage CSL patches and instrument libraries.

<P>
The heart of CSL is its unit generator and signal processing class
library: the subclasses of FrameStream. There are several ``control
sources'' such as wavetable oscillators, noise sources, chaotic generators,
FFT/IFFT. Signal processors such as filters and panners take synthesis
graphs as inputs. They are subclasses of both FrameStream and the
mix-in Processor class. CSL includes canonical form FIR filters, panners,
mixers, convolution and flexible delay lines. Simple operators are
handled by the <TT>AddOp</TT> and <TT>MulOp</TT> unit generator.

<P>
A CSL program is a graph of DSP units, generally a number of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patches</SPAN>
(subgraphs) connected to a mixer. This graph has a single <SPAN  CLASS="textit">root</SPAN>
node, usually the output unit generator or a mixer taking several
subgraphs at its inputs. Different sound file formats can be loaded
into a graph. The evaluation of a graph is triggered by the pull of
an <TT>IO</TT> object (an instance of the <TT>IO</TT> class) that
is usually connected to a direct output API such as PortAudio [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BencinaPortAudio">Bencina and Burk, 2001</A>],
to a socket-base network protocol or a sound file.

<P>
The blocks of samples can be sent through sockets using a protocol
based on UDP in which data packets have a header that incorporates
an instance ID and sequence number. The mixer and the spatializer
are CSL programs that perform no synthesis but instead read sample
blocks from other CSL instances over a network and process them. 

<P>
CSL can be used in distributed systems. The framework is callable
from Open Sound Control [<A
 HREF="node207.html#WrightOSC-ICMC">Wright, 1998a</A>] or Corba. Its output
samples can be sent directly to an output device or to a network socket.
Process in different machines support inter-machine sample streaming
and are integrated in the CREATE Real-Time Application Manager [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeCRAM">Pope et&nbsp;al., 2001</A>].

<P>
In the basic CSL framework there is no essential difference between
constant values, control signals and audio signals. Samples are usually
32 bits floats though this can be changed to integer or 64 bits with
a single definition. All processing is done in blocks typically between
32 and 1024 sample frame in size. Envelopes are breakpoint functions
of time. There are helper classes that provide constructors for standard
envelope types: triangle, AR, ADSR, various windows, etc...

<P>
The main declarations are in the FrameStream.h file which defines
the following classes: <TT>Buffer</TT>, the basic n-channel sample
buffer class; <TT>FrameStream</TT>, the central abstraction in CSL;
<TT>SampleStream</TT>, an l-channel frame stream; <TT>Processor</TT>,
a mix-in for framestreams that process an input frame stream; <TT>Writeable</TT>,
a mix-in for framestreams that one can write into; <TT>Phased</TT>,
a mix-in for framestreams with phase accumulators; <TT>Positionable</TT>,
a mix-in for framestreams that one can position; <TT>IO</TT>, an input/output
stream or driver abstraction.

<P>
Instances of the <TT>Buffer</TT> class represent multi-channel sample
buffers. They have memory pointers to sample storage as well as a
set of flags about the storage state (allocated, zero, populated...).
<TT>FrameStreams</TT> are objects that can generate buffers of frames
where a frame is a collection of samples that are meant to be manipulated
simultaneously. <TT>SampleStream</TT> is a <TT>FrameStream</TT> of
special importance. It is a one channel <TT>FrameStream</TT> that
copies the single channel to all its outputs. The class <TT>Gestalt</TT>
has static methods for the sample rate, default buffer size, safe
memory allocation. <TT>ThreadedFrameStream</TT> uses a background
thread to compute samples. It caches buffers from its producing subgraphs
and feeds them to its consumer thread on demand. It controls the scheduling
of the producer. This introduces latency but not jitter. When <TT>FrameStreams</TT>
and <TT>Processors</TT> need different buffer sizes, a <TT>BlockResizer</TT>
object can be placed between two elements of the DSP graph.

<P>
An Instrument has a DSP graph, a set of reflective accessors and a
list of envelopes. The DSP graph is the instrument's ``patch'',
the accessors define the controls and the envelope list holds the
envelopes that need to be triggered to start a new note. Using the
instrument/accessor framework one can set a CSL program to respond
to commands coming from a variety of sources such as OSC, MIDI, CORBA
or score file readers.

<P>
There are several versions of the CSL <TT>main()</TT> although in
some uses CSL is not even involved in the <TT>main()</TT>. Since CSL
is simply a C++ class, it can be used in different ways: incorporate
it as a component of another application, use CSL to build plug-ins,
build an application with a graphical user interface than controls
CSL synthesis and processing.

<P>
Different applications have been developed using CSL:

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Sensing/Speaking Space</SPAN> is an interactive audio/video installation.
A computer vision system analyzes the movement of spectators and sends
OSC messages to a sound synthesis server. The first version of the
server was written in Supercollider (see <A HREF="node82.html#sub:SuperCollider">2.6.1</A>)
but suffered from low reliability, excessive memory usage (1 GB) and
poor debuggability. The final version written in CSL was very reliable
during a week and sounded just like the first version. In both versions
the code is about 1200 lines, including helper classes and a GUI with
sliders to mix different layers.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ouroboros</SPAN> is an application for processing, sampling, and looping
audio input and sound files. In this case, CSL is not used for processing,
the program hosts AudioUnits, the standard plug-in format for MacOSX,
and lets the users create graphs of AudioUnits to process sound. CSL
is used for simplifying the reading and writing of audio files and
for capturing and looping the sound. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">OndeCorner</SPAN> is an AudioUnit
plug-in written in CSL. It transforms audio to the wavelet domain
and lets users modify coefficients with a variety of processes. Apart
from being an example of plug-in writing in CSL it also shows how
to integrate DSP code from different sources.

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Reverb plug-in</SPAN> was developed on a graduate course on spatial
sound, when students used CSL to implement reverberation algorithms.
It was later used for a convolution-based reverberator and HRTF-based
spatializer using the FFTW library.

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Expert Mastering Assistant</SPAN> is the largest project using
CSL. It is an expert system that uses fine-grained multi-level music
analysis to suggest parameters for signal processing to be applied
during music mastering. It uses a combination of CSL, AudioUnits and
third-party DSP code.

<P>
CSL is still in its first stages of development and the authors recognize
not feeling particularly comfortable with the C++ language. Nevertheless
this first approach is already more important than it may seem. The
main author is highly experienced, has designed other related environments
(see <A HREF="node73.html#sub:MODE-and-Siren">2.4</A>, for instance) and may be considered
an authority in the field. CSL is a clear recognition of two facts:
(1) C++ is better suited than Smalltalk for building efficient audio
frameworks, and (2) languages like Supercollider (see <A HREF="node82.html#sub:SuperCollider">2.6.1</A>)
end-up not being convenient for building some efficient applications
(the author presents the framework as a substitute of Supercollider
for some particular tasks).
