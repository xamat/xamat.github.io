Initial Glossary 
</H1>

<P>
A large part of this work is about concepts and definitions. All of
them will be thoroughly defined and commented in the corresponding
sections. Nevertheless, and in order to establish a common glossary
and start stating a point of view, it is interesting to first give
a short definition of some terms.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt63">Object</SPAN>:Physical or abstract entity that can be conceptually
isolated due to its high cohesion and low coupling with other entities.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt64">Class</SPAN>: A set of related objects with the same behaviour
and internal structure.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt65">System</SPAN>: We will see throughout this thesis how the word
system has slightly different meanings and interpretations depending
on the context. However, we will accept as a sufficiently generic
definition, the one given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronical
Engineerings professional group in System Science and Cybernetics
when they state that a system is `` a large collection of interacting
functional units that together achieve a defined purpose'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#RoweSystemCybernetics">Rowe, 1965</A>].

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt68">Model</SPAN>: A model can be understood as the formal abstract
representation of a given system. A single system can be represented
through different models, depending on the level of abstraction required
and foreseen use.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt69">Metamodel</SPAN>: A model that explains a set of related models.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt70">Paradigm</SPAN>: The most commonly accepted definition of paradigm
is that of Thomas Kuhn who describes a paradigm as the set of common
beliefs and agreements shared between scientists about how problems
should be understood and addressed [<A
 HREF="node207.html#KuhnScientificRevolution">Kuhn, 1962</A>]. 

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt72">Framework</SPAN>: A framework (in the Software Engineering domain)
is an abstract design of a set of related applications in a particular
domain. This abstraction can be then instantiated to build a concrete
application. 

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt73">Metaphor</SPAN>: According to [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BeckMetaphorMetaphor">Beck, 2002</A>], a
metaphor is the linking of two sets of concepts so one set of concepts
is understood in terms of another.

<P>
<SPAN ID="txt75">Signal</SPAN>: A function of one or more independent variables
that contains information about the behavior or structure of a given
phenomena [<A
 HREF="node207.html#Openheim">Openheim and Willsky, 1997</A>].

<P>
All these concepts and the way they relate will be further explained
and discussed and will build the conceptual framework upon which this
thesis is based. But as a first introduction it may be well worth
to add a few considerations that can already help better understand
the above given definitions and the way they conceptually relate.

<P>
