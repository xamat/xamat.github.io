MODE and Siren
</H2>

<P>
The MODE [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeMODE91">Pope, 1991c</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeMODE94">Pope, 1994</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeOOinMODE">Pope, 1991b</A>] was a collection
of OO classes for general sound, event, event list and score processing
as well as a music oriented user interface tool kit, embedded in the
Smalltalk-80 Programming System. The MODE was substituted by Siren
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSirenBookChapter">Pope, 2001</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSirenOOPSLA">Pope, 1998a</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSirenRecentDevelopments">Pope, 2003</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-Siren">www-Siren, </A>]
in 1998.

<P>
Both frameworks are the result of the author's, Stephen Travis Pope,
continuous iterations in order to find a tool for his compositions
as well as a platform for practically demonstrating his research on
object-oriented programming and software engineering[<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeMachineTonguesIX">Pope, 1991d</A>].
As such, they implement a quite particular vision of musical composition
that is tightly integrated with an object-oriented model[<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeOOinMODE">Pope, 1991b</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeOOMusic">Pope, 1997</A>].
Both frameworks have been developed taking into account very little
inputs from users and as the author observes ``(...) if Siren works
well for other composers, it is because of its idiosyncratic approach,
rather than its attempted generality''[<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSirenBookChapter">Pope, 2001</A>].

<P>
Before taking a look at the MODE and Siren, let us summarize the different
packages and versions the author has worked on.

<P>
The MODE was already the result of several iterations of Smalltalk-80
based toolkits for musical score and sound processing and performance.
It was itself a reimplementation of the author's earlier package,
the HyperScore ToolKit [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSmalltalkMusikKit">Pope, 1987</A>], son of DoubleTalk,
son of ARA. ARA was a Lisp system. Double-Talk was a Petri net editing
system in Smalltalk-80.

<P>
Siren is a software framework that includes a set of flexible and
reusable components that are designed for extension and customization
but also carries with it a ``way of thinking'' about music and
composition. It has been developed in the Smalltalk language and it
is intended to be used by Smalltalk-80 programmers. Previous systems
strove for extreme flexibility at the expense of additional complexity
but Siren makes decisions differently.

<P>
The system is designed to accept pluggable front ends and back ends.
It is efficient for real-time composition and portable as it runs
in several OS. Application areas are: sound and score editors, real-time
algorithmic composition, and music performance front ends. The purpose
of the framework is to provide comprehensive note, score and sound
processing tools for the rapid prototyping of music applications.
The framework includes an abstract music representation language,
an interface for real-time I/O, a user interface framework, and connection
to object databases. It is also integrated with a scalable distributed
processing framework.

<P>
Siren is a software framework for sound and music composition and
production made of about 350 Smalltalk classes. It is platform independent
and runs on Macintosh, Windows, and Unix-based computers. The Smalltalk
code is available for free.

<P>
The motivation behind the MODE and now Siren was to build a powerful,
flexible, and portable computer-based composer's tool and instrument.
Siren is designed to support composition, off-line realization, and
live performance. Other desired applications are music databases,
music analysis and music scholarship and pedagogy.

<P>
On the other hand, the technical goal is to present good OO design
principles and elegant state-of-the-art software engineering practice.
It needs to be easily extensible, to provide abstract models of high-level
musical constructs and flexible management of large datasets.

<P>
The main components or packages in Siren are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Smoke music representation language (classes for music magnitudes,
events, event list, generators, functions and sounds).
</LI>
<LI>voices, schedules and I/O drivers (real-time and file-based I/O for
sound, OSC, and MIDI).
</LI>
<LI>user interface components for musical applications (tools and music/sound
widget).
</LI>
<LI>several built-in applications (editors and browsers for Siren objects).
</LI>
</UL>
It is possible to use inheritance for building specialized versions
of existing components.

<P>
Smoke [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSmoke">Pope, 1992</A>] is the ``kernel'' of Siren. It is a set
of classes organized in meta-categories such as Magnitudes, Events
and EventLists, Schedulers, or Interfaces. Smoke is described in terms
of two description languages: a compact binary interchange format
and a mapping onto concrete data structures.

<P>
According to the author Smoke can be summarized as follows: Music
can be represented as a series of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">events</SPAN>. Events are simply
property lists or dictionaries that can have named properties with
arbitrary values. These properties may be music-specific objects and
for that reason models of many common musical magnitudes are provided.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Music Magnitudes</SPAN> are extensible abstract representations for
the properties of musical events such as pitch, duration and loudness.
Each Music Magnitude can have different representations (e.g. pitch
can be represented in integer, float, string or fraction). Their primary
behavior is that they can translate freely between their representations.
<TT>MusicMagnitude</TT> objects are characterized by their <SPAN  CLASS="textit">identity</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">class</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">species</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">values</SPAN> (e.g. the pitch object
representing the note C3 is a member of the class <TT>SymbolicPitch</TT>,
of the species Pitch and has a value of c3 (note that class+species
allows for multiple inheritance).

<P>
The basic abstract model classes are <TT>Pitch</TT>, <TT>Loudness</TT>
and <TT>Duration</TT>. They are abstract and have no subclasses, they
are used by species for families of classes.

<P>
The basic event classes, <TT>Event</TT> and <TT>EventList</TT> both
of which derive from <TT>AbstractEvent</TT>, are used for describing
musical structures. In Smoke, an event is simply an object that has
a duration and possibly arbitrary other properties. The <TT>AbstractEvent</TT>
in Smoke is modeled as a property-list dictionary with a duration.
There is no prescribed grain size or level for events.

<P>
<TT>EventList</TT> hold collections of events sorted by start time.
Event lists are events in themselves and can therefore be nested into
trees in a hierarchical structure. An event can be in more than one
list at different relative start times and with different properties
mapped into it. <TT>Events</TT> don't know their start-time, which
is always relative to some outer scope. 

<P>
<TT>Events</TT> and <TT>EventLists</TT> are ``performed'' by the
action of a scheduler that passes them to an interpretation object
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Voice</SPAN>. Voices map event properties onto IO parameters.

<P>
<TT>NoteEvent</TT> classes are like generic <TT>Events</TT> that represent
musical notes with the default parameters pitch, amplitude and voice.
Links between events and event lists can have some symbolic description
(e.g. <TT>isVariationOf</TT>, <TT>isTonalAnswerTo</TT>...)

<P>
Sampled sounds can be properties of events. The <TT>Sound</TT> class
allows reading and writing a number of file formats and maintains
a list of named cue points in the sound.

<P>
Siren has classes for representing ``middle-level'' structures
e.g. cluster, chord, ostinato or rubato. Music formats can be characterized
in a very compact way. Two abstract classes are defined: <TT>EventGenerator</TT>
and <TT>EventModifier</TT>. Composers can enrich the generator hierarchy
for a specific composition. 

<P>
<TT>EventGenerators</TT> can either return an <TT>EventList</TT> or
behave like processes and be told to play and stop. The three abstract
<TT>EventGenerators</TT> are <TT>Cluster</TT>, <TT>Cloud</TT> and
<TT>Ostinato</TT>. <TT>Cluster</TT> classes describe a one-dimensional
collection of pitches or rhythms (their events occur simultaneously
or are repetitions of the same event). Concrete types of <TT>Clusters</TT>
are chords and arpeggi. <TT>Cloud</TT> classes are random generators
that produce notes from a given range. Most process-oriented generators
take the form of <TT>Ostinati</TT>, which create repeating versions
or variations of the input material or parameters.

<P>
The <TT>EventModifier</TT> class models objects that have a function
object and a property name so they can apply the function to the given
property of an <TT>Event</TT> or an <TT>EventList</TT>. <TT>EventModifiers</TT>
can be lazy or eager. Eager <TT>EventModifiers</TT> apply the function
as soon as they are given an <TT>EventList</TT> while lazy wait until
scheduling time.

<P>
Using the messages to the previous basic classes one can make scripts
(programs) of messages to <TT>Events</TT>, <TT>EventLists</TT> and
<TT>Functions</TT> to describe simple musical processes. Regular messages
from the Smalltalk-80 environment can be used to inspect objects.

<P>
Siren has a special structure that allows the same score to be played
independently of the final synthesis method. Properties of events
are encoded in an abstract symbolic way that is then expanded into
device-specific or output format-specific parameters.

<P>
Siren also has a complete graphical environment that can be used to
develop graphical applications for music processing.

<P>
One of the basic problems for making cross-platform music tools was
the lack of good portable APIs for sound and MIDI I/O. This has been
helped recently by cross-platform libraries such PortAudio [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BencinaPortAudio">Bencina and Burk, 2001</A>],
PortMIDI [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-PortMIDI">www-PortMIDI, </A>] or LibSndFile [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-libsndfile">www-libsndfile, </A>].
All of these libraries are implemented in C/C++ and it was difficult
to integrate them into Smalltalk. But VisualWorks has a powerful for
interfacing Smalltalk code to C libraries. 

<P>
For network and file-oriented IO, it uses Open Sound Control (OSC)[<A
 HREF="node207.html#WrightOSC-ICMC">Wright, 1998a</A>].
Siren has also been used as a front-end to CSL (see <A HREF="node67.html#sub:CSL">2.3.3</A>)
through OSC messages.

<P>
The author of Siren has also implement the Create Real-Time Application
Manager (CRAM) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeCRAM">Pope et&nbsp;al., 2001</A>] for large-scale distributed processing.
Siren and CSL are designed to be used in distributed systems controlled
by CORBA and with messages sent through OSC.

<P>
Also recently new class libraries have been added to support using
large speech databases with phoneme segmentation and detailed feature
extraction. The analysis core of the Siren speech database is the
Segmenter, which uses a combination of time-domain and spectral-domain
features to break continuous speech into phonemes.

<P>
Although as already commented most of the applications developed with
the Siren/MODE framework are musical composition environments, the
frameworks is sufficiently flexible so as to be used in different
situations. Paleo, for instance, is a suite of sound and music analysis
tools integrated with an OO persistence mechanism in Siren. Paleo
uses dynamic feature vectors and on-demand indexing. Annotational
information derived from analysis can be added to the database at
any time. Paleo performs analysis of MIDI files and allows for complex
queries.

<P>
Most of the advantages and disadvantages of Siren are related to its
language of choice, Smalltalk. These are, according to its author
the most important advantages of Smalltalk and therefore Siren:

<P>
Smalltalk is a simple programming language; the class library is quite
compact and extense especially when compared to C++; Smalltalk has
an extensive development environment with code browsers or in-place
debugger; finally, it is important to point out that the language,
libraries and IDE have been quite stable for the last 20 years.

<P>
As disadvantages he cites the following: Smalltalk now is not a mainstream
language; the VisualWorks/Smalltalk implementation is large (2000
classes + 300 Siren classes), this is a very large system to learn;
like in Java, Smalltalk programs are generally compiled to a virtual
machine which may be interpreted, translated or cross-compiled at
run-time, this provides cross-platform portability of object code
but at the cost of some run-time performance; garbage collection also
makes development easier but also adds overhead; finally the Siren
package itself is complex and implements a very particular design
approaches. It does not include MIDI sequencing or common music notation
editors due to lack of interest by the authors. They do with Siren
what they cannot do with a combination of SuperCollider, Peak, Finale
and ProTools.

<P>
New applications in different areas are planned for Siren [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSirenRecentDevelopments">Pope, 2003</A>]
such as controlling graphical animation from Siren. But probably the
most surprising news is that, after 20 years of Smalltalk development,
the author is thinking on changing to a different language. At the
moment of this writing, they are experimenting with Ruby, Self, and
Supercollider. Porting Siren to another language means keeping Smoke's
class library specification but abandoning its syntax that is too
Smalltalk-oriented. Smoke event list are then written in the language
as the implementation being used.
