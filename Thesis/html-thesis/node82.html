Supercollider [<A
 HREF="node207.html#McCartneySupercolliderCMJ">McCartney, 2002</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSuperCollider">Pope, 2004</A>]
is a language for sound and image processing developed by James McCartney.
It can be considered as a Music-N style language in its use of unit
generators and other concepts such as instrument, orchestra or events.
Nevertheless it presents important differences in respect to traditional
Music-N languages such as CSound (see <A HREF="node83.html#sub:CSound">2.6.1</A>). The main
differences are: (1) most Supercollider programs can run in real-time
and process live sound and MIDI inputs/outputs; (2) Supercollider
is a comprehensive general-purpose programming language with facilities
for file input/output, list processing, and OO programming; and (3)
Supercollider is an integrated development environment.

<P>
Supercollider has been implemented in Apple Macintosh and Be computers
though more ports are planned. It is a high-level programming language
with a syntax derived from C++ and Smalltalk. Its development environment
includes a program text editor, rapid compiler, run-time system and
a GUI builder. Supercollider Instruments can take their inputs from
real-time MIDI controllers and can process audio files and live sound
input.

<P>
Motivations for the design of Supercollider were the ability to realize
sound processes that were different every time they played, write
pieces describing ranges of possibilities rather than fixed entities
and to facilitate live improvisation by a composer/performer.

<P>
Supercollider computes control functions and other values at a lower
rate than the sampling rate called the ``sub-frame'' size. Its
default value is 64 though it can be set to any value between 4 and
256. In Supercollider, data is played as it is generated.

<P>
SC's syntax is an OO programming language, with a syntax mixture of
C++ and Smalltalk. In SC one can program in two styles: function-oriented
or message-passing. As in most programming languages, there are different
kinds of statements: comments, declarations, assignments and control
structures. The language includes everything you would expect to find
in a general programming language but also includes specific functions
for music and signal processing.

<P>
In a typical SC program there are several parts: (1) Header: title,
comment, date, version...; (2) Declarations: declare output buffers,
sound files, function tables...(required); (3) Init function: run
at compile time if present (optional); (4) Start function: called
at run-time if present, runs the instruments (normally present though
optional); (5) Instrument functions: can be called from the Start
function.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Unit generators</SPAN> are regular OO objects with constructors, and
evaluation methods. SC also has support for OO classes and inheritance.
The <TT>UGen</TT> class provides the abstraction of a unit generator,
and the <TT>Synth</TT> class represents a group of <TT>UGens</TT>
operating as a group to generate an output. The unit generator API
is a simple C interface.

<P>
An <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Instrument</SPAN> is constructed functionally. When writing a sound-processing
function one is actually writing a function that creates and connects
unit generators. This is different from a static object specification
of a network of unit generators. Instruments in Supercollider can
``generate'' a network of unit generators.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">composition</SPAN> can be considered as a sequence of events and
this abstraction is accomplished via the concept of a stream. A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">stream</SPAN>
is an object to which the next message can be sent to get the next
element. A stream ends when it returns nil. By default, all objects
in Supercollider respond to next by returning themselves so any object
can be used as an infinite stream of itself. An event stream returns
dictionaries that map symbols to values, the composition code does
not need to know anything about an instrument argument list and may
contain any set of parameters.

<P>
Supercollider was originally designed to combine a high-level language
and a synthesis engine. But later some reasons were found to separate
the composition language from a synthesis engine [<A
 HREF="node207.html#McCartneySupercolliderCMJ">McCartney, 2002</A>].
The main reason is that some synthesis processing time must be consumed
generating events, if the composition language is separated it can
run in the background generating events.

<P>
That is why in Supercollider Server the synthesis engine and the language
were separated and are now two applications that communicate via a
slightly modified version of Open Sound Control (OSC) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#WrightOSC-ICMC">Wright, 1998a</A>].
This allows to run several instances of the synthesis engine either
in different processors or machines. Controlling the synthesis engine
is as simple as opening a socket and sending commands, so any program
(Max, a C++ program...) could control it.

<P>
In Supercollider 3 Synth Server, while synthesis is playing new modules
can be created, destroyed or repatched and sample buffers can be created
and reallocated. All commands are received via TCP or UDP using the
simplified version of OSC. If MIDI is desired, it is up to the client
to convert it to OSC commands for the synthesis engine.

<P>
There are two versions of the Supercollider Server synthesis engine.
One uses a block computation model and unit generator plug-ins. Instruments
are loaded as files that describe patches of these unit generators.
This version has a control rate and audio rate. The other version
implements single-sample computation with the instruments loaded as
compiled plug-ins. The synthesis class library can generate C++ code
to be loaded by the synthesis engine. Instead of a single control
rate any unit generator may run at any power of two division of the
audio clock rate. Only source unit generators need to specify the
computation rate.

<P>
All running modules are ordered in a tree of nodes that define an
order of execution. There are two types of nodes: Synths and Groups.
A Synth is just a collection of unit generators that can be addressed
together. A Group is a collection of Nodes.

<P>
Synths send audio and control signals to each other via a a pair of
global arrays of audio and control buses. Using buses allows to connect
Synths without a priori knowledge about them. The lowest-numbered
audio busses get written to the audio hardware outputs, then there
are the audio input buses.

<P>
The Supercollider user interface has a program text editor, a message
output view and an instrument user interface view. But a GUI can also
be created with Supercollider.
