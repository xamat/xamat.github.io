SMS Analysis/Synthesis Example</A>
</H3>

<P>
At the time CLAM was started the MTG's flagship applications were
SMSCommandLine and SMSTools. As a matter of fact one of the main goals
when starting CLAM was to develop the substitute for those applications
(see Annex <A HREF="node208.html#cha:CLAM-Additional-Information">A</A>). The SMS Analysis/Synthesis
example substitutes those applications and therefore illustrates the
core of the research being carried out at the MTG.

<P>
The application has three different versions: SMSTools, which has
a FLTK graphical user interface; SMSConsole, which is a command-line
based version; and SMSBatch, which can be used for batch processing
a whole directory. Out of these three it is clearly the graphical
version that can find more usages, the other two are only used for
very specific problems. The rest of this section will concentrate
on the graphical version and only mention some differences with the
other versions where strictly necessary.

<P>
The main goal of the application is to analyze, transform and synthesize
back a given sound. For doing so, it uses the Sinusoidal plus Residual
model (see section <A HREF="node230.html#sec:_Spectral_Processing">B</A>). In order to do
so the application has a number of possible different inputs:

<P>
1. An XML <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">configuration</SPAN> file. This configuration file is
used to configure both the analysis and synthesis processes. 

<P>
2. An SDIF or XML <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">analysis</SPAN> file. This file will be the result
of a previously performed and stored analysis. The XML parser is rather
slow and the XML format is rather verbose. For all those reasons the
storing/loading of analysis data, although fully working, is not recommended
unless you want to have a textual/readable representation of your
analysis result, else you will be better off using the SDIF format
(see next paragraph). 

<P>
3. A <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Transformation score</SPAN> in XML format. This file includes
a list of all transformations that will be applied to the result of
the analysis and the configuration for each of the transformations. 

<P>
Note that all of them can be selected and generated on run-time from
the user interface in the SMSTools version.

<P>
From these inputs, the application is able to generate the following
outputs:

<P>
1. An XML or SDIF <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Analysis data</SPAN> file. 

<P>
2. An XML <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Melody</SPAN> file. 

<P>
3. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Output sound</SPAN>: global sound, sinusoidal component, residual
component 

<P>
Figure <A HREF="#fig:SMS-Tools-block-diagram">3.7</A> illustrates the main blocks
of the application.

<P>
The output of the analysis is a <TT>CLAM::Segment</TT> that contains
an ordered list of <TT>CLAM::Frames</TT>. Each of these frames has
a number of attributes, but the most important are: a <TT>CLAM::SpectralPeakArray</TT>
that models the sinusoidal component (including information about
sinusoidal track), a residual spectrum and the result of the fundamental
frequency detection algorithm.

<P>
The output of this analysis can be (1) stored in XML or SDIF format,
(2) transformed and (3) synthesized back.

<P>
In order to make the application work, a valid configuration XML file
must be loaded although the the default one can also be edited through
the graphical interface. This configuration includes all the different
parameters for the analysis/synthesis process. The following is an
example of a valid XML configuration:

<P>
We will now briefly describe the different parameters involved:
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN ID="txt2409">Global Parameters:</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;Name&gt;</SPAN>: particular name for the configuration file. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;InputSoundFile&gt;</SPAN>: path and name of the input sound file to
analyze. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;OutputSoundFile&gt;</SPAN>: path and name of where the output synthesized
sound file must be stored. The application will add a &#34;_sin.wav&#34;
termination to the Sinusoidal component and a &#34;_res.wav&#34;
termination the residual file name. In the graphical version of the
program (SMSTools) though, this parameter is not used as when the
output sound is to be stored, a file browser dialog pops-up.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;OutputAnalysisFile&gt;</SPAN>: path and name of where the output analysis
data is to be stored. The extension of the file can be .xml or .sdif.
The application will choose the correct format depending on the extension
you give. Not used in the GUI version as it is obtained from the dialog.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;InputAnalysisFile&gt;</SPAN>: path and name of where the input analysis
data to is be loaded from. Not used in the GUI version as it is obtained
from the dialog.
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN ID="txt2419">Analysis Parameters:</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisWindowSize&gt;</SPAN>: window size in number of samples for
the analysis of the sinusoidal component. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;ResAnalysisWindowSize&gt;</SPAN>: window size in number of samples
for the analysis of the residual component. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisWindowType&gt;</SPAN>: type of window used for the sinusoidal
analysis. Available: Hamming, Triangular, BlackmannHarris62,
BlackmannHarris70, BlackmannHarris74, BlackmannHarris92,
KaisserBessel17, KaisserBessel18, KaisserBessel19,
KaisserBessel20, KaisserBessel25, KaisserBessel30,
KaisserBessel35.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;ResAnalysisWindowType&gt;</SPAN>: type of window used for the residual
analysis. Available: Same as in sinusoidal. Recommended: as sinusoidal
spectrum is synthesized using the transform of the BlackmannHarris
92dB, it is necessary to use that window in the analysis of the residual
component in order to get good results.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisHopSize&gt;</SPAN>: hop size in number of samples. It is the
same both for the sinusoidal and residual component. If this parameter
is set to -1 (which means default), it is taken as half the residual
window size. Recommended values range from half to a quarter of the
residual window size.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisZeroPaddingFactor&gt;</SPAN> Zero padding factor applied to
both components. 0 means that zeros will be added to the input audio
frame till it reaches the next power of two, 1 means that zeros will
be added to the next power of two etc...

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisPeakDetectMagThreshold&gt;</SPAN>: magnitude threshold in
dB's in order to say that a given peak is valid or not. Recommended:
depending on the window type and the main-to-secondary lobe relation
and the characteristics of the input sound, a good value for this
parameter may range between -80 to -150 dB.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisPeakDetectMaxFreq&gt;</SPAN>: Frequency of the highest sinusoid
to be tracked. This parameter can be adjusted, for example, if you
are analyzing a sound that you know only has harmonics up to a certain
frequency. Recommended: It depends on the input sound but, in general,
a sensible value is 8000 to 10000 Hz.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisSinTrackingFreqDeviation&gt;</SPAN>: maximum deviation in
hertz for a sinusoidal track.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalyisReferenceFundFreq&gt;</SPAN>: in hertz, reference fundamental.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalyisLowestFundFreq&gt;</SPAN>: in hertz, lowest fundamental frequency
to be acknowledged.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalyisHighestFundFreq&gt;</SPAN>: in hertz, highest fundamental frequency
to be acknowledged.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalyisMaxFundFreqError&gt;</SPAN>: maximum error in hertz for the
fundamental detection algorithm.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalyisMaxFundCandidates&gt;</SPAN>: maximum number of candidate frequencies
for the fundamental detection algorithm.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;AnalysisHarmonic&gt;</SPAN>: if 1, harmonic analysis is performed
on all segments that have a valid pitch. In those segments the track
number assigned to each peak corresponds to the harmonic number. On
unvoiced segments, inharmonic analysis is still performed. 
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN ID="txt2435">Synthesis Parameters:</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;SynthesisFrameSize&gt;</SPAN>: in number of samples, size of the synthesis
frame. If set to -1, it is computed as (ResAnalysisWindowSize-1)/2. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;SynthesisWindowType&gt;</SPAN>: type of window used for the residual
analysis. Available: Same as in sinusoidal.
<BR>
<P>
<SPAN ID="txt2438">Morph Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">&lt;MorphSoundFile&gt;</SPAN>: Optional name of the second file to do
a morph on. Only necessary if a morphing transformation is planned.
Note that the file to morph will be analyzed with the same parameters
as the input sound file and that it must have the same sampling rate.

<P>
&nbsp;

<P>
Apart from storing the result of the analysis, more interesting things
can be accomplished. The first thing that may be interesting to do
is to synthesize it back, separating each component: residual, sinusoidal,
and the sum of both. 

<P>
To transform your sound an XML transformation score must be loaded
or created using the graphical transformation editor available in
SMSTools. New transformations can be implemented and added to the
CLAM repository very easily.

<P>
The main class of the application is the <TT>SMSApplication</TT> class.
This is an abstract class (thus cannot be instantiated), but contains
the core of the process flow. The three derived classes, <TT>SMSTools</TT>,
<TT>SMSBatch</TT> and <TT>SMSStdio</TT> implement the particular versions
of the base class.

<P>
So let us briefly mention what this base class holds inside. All the
methods illustrated in the diagram (<TT>LoadConfig</TT>, <TT>Analyze</TT>,...)
correspond to functionalities of the program that, in the case of
the GUI version, are mapped directly to menu options. 

<P>
The associated <TT>SMSAppState</TT> class is responsible for maintaining
the current state of the application. The boolean (<TT>mHaveConfig</TT>,
<TT>mHaveInputAudio</TT>,....) attributes of the class hold important
values to control the flow of the program because they inform of whether
a previous action has taken place and the desired operation can then
be invoked.

<P>
The class has two <TT>ProcessingComposite</TT> attributes (see <A HREF="node111.html#sec:_ProcessingInfrastructure">3.2.2</A>),
instances of the <TT>SMSAnalysis</TT> and <TT>SMSSynthesis</TT> classes.
These <TT>ProcessingComposites</TT> are configured when the global
configuration is loaded and then run from the <TT>Analyze</TT> and
<TT>Synthesize</TT> methods. Some intermediate Processing Data (a
<TT>Segment</TT>, a <TT>Melody</TT> and different <TT>Audio</TT> objects)
are used to hold the input/output data generated during the process.
These data are then stored/played using the corresponding method (i.e.
<TT>StoreAnalysis</TT> or <TT>PlayOutputSound</TT>).

<P>
Although the <TT>SMSApplication</TT> class concentrates most of the
functionality of the application and has a great deal of operations,
these methods are fairly simple and rarely need more than 10/20 lines
of code. In order to invoke an analysis, for instance, only the <TT>SMSAnalysis::Do</TT>
method needs to be called. This is possible because these Processing
Composites hide all the processing complexity. If we take a look again
to the UML diagram we see that these classes contain inside a great
deal of other Processing classes. Let us enumerate them and their
basic functionality.

<P>
Inside the <TT>SMSAnalysis</TT> we have:

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SpectralAnalysis</SPAN></TT>: Performs an STFT of the sound.
For doing so, it holds a number of Processing objects inside, namely
a <TT>WindowGenerator</TT>, an <TT>AudioMultiplier</TT>, a <TT>CircularShift</TT>
(for zero-phase buffer centering) and an <TT>FFT</TT>. Note that the
<TT>SMSAnalysis</TT> has two instances of this class: one for the
sinusoidal component and another one for the residual. This Processing
Composite is quite complex in itself but we won't go into details.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SpectralPeakDetect</SPAN></TT>: Implements an algorithm for
choosing the spectral peaks out of the previously computed spectrum.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">FundFreqDetect</SPAN></TT>: Processing for computing the fundamental
frequency.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SinTracking</SPAN></TT>: This Processing performs sinusoidal
tracking or peak continuation from one frame to the next one. It implements
an inharmonic and harmonic version of the algorithm.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SynthSineSpectrum</SPAN></TT>: Once we have analyzed the sinusoidal
component and we have the continued peaks we have to synthesize it
back to spectrum in order to compute the residual component. This
is the Processing in charge of this synthesis of the sinusoidal component.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SpectrumSubstracter2</SPAN></TT>: Once we have the sinusoidal
synthesized spectrum and the original one (coming out from the residual
Spectral Analysis), we can subtract them in order to obtain the residual
spectrum.

<P>
The <TT>SMSSynthesis</TT> Processing Composite contains:

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">PhaseManagement</SPAN></TT>: This Processing is in charge of
managing phase of spectral peaks, from one frame to the next one.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SynthSineSpectrum</SPAN></TT>: As already commented in the <TT>SMSAnalysis</TT>,
this object is in charge of creating a synthetic spectrum out of the
array of spectral peaks.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SpectrumAdder2</SPAN></TT>: It is used to add the residual and
the synthesized sinusoidal spectrum.

<P>
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SpectralSynthesis</SPAN></TT>: This processing composite implements
the inverse STFT. That is, is the object in charge of computing an
output audio frame from an input spectrum. The <TT>SMSSynthesis</TT>
class has three instances of this class: one for the global output
sound, one for the residual and one for the sinusoidal component.
The <TT>SpectralSynthesis</TT> Processing Composite has the following
processing inside: an <TT>IFFT</TT>, two <TT>WindowGenerators</TT>
(one for the inverse Analysis window and one for the Synthesis Triangular
window), an <TT>AudioProduct</TT> to actually perform the windowing,
a <TT>CircularShift</TT> to undo the circular shift or buffer-centering
introduced in the analysis and an <TT>OverlapAdd</TT> object to finally
apply this process to the output windowed audio frames. It is fairly
complex in itself and we would need to go into too many signal processing
details in order to explain it completely (see Annex <A HREF="node230.html#sec:_Spectral_Processing">B</A>
for more details on these signal processing algorithms).
