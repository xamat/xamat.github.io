DSPOOM as a Classification of DSP Objects</A>
</H1>

<P>
As presented in section <A HREF="node21.html#sub:Metamodels">1.2.4</A> a metamodel such as
DSPOOM aims at abstracting commonalities between a set of related
models and presenting an abstract ``model of models''. Abstract
metaclasses are actually acting as concrete class classifiers and
as a matter of fact the relation between a metaclass (abstract class
in the metamodel) and a concrete class is the same as the relation
existing between a concrete class and its instances.

<P>
The infrastructure offered by CLAM and reviewed in the previous chapter
can be understood as a set of objects and the way they interact. Most
of these objects belong to three classes: Processing, ProcessingData
and Network. These classes define the way that most CLAM objects contribute
to the configuration of a given application, being this application
in itself a CLAM model of a particular system. The three classes are
abstract and therefore cannot be instantiated by themselves, but they
define the model a CLAM system will comply to. In other words, a CLAM
model can be described by the way that particular instances of these
classes behave and interact in between them.

<P>
In a similar way DSPOOM classifies objects into four categories: objects
that process (Processings), objects that hold data necessary for the
process (Processing Data), objects that connect or interface (such
as ports, data nodes or controls), and application or system-level
objects. 

<P>
Of these categories, the first two are much more important in their
scope and the other two can be seen as auxiliary but necessary for
completing the metamodel. The basic idea is to separate objects that
encapsulate a process called Processing objects and objects that undergo
a certain process encapsulating a kind of data object and are called
Processing Data objects. This clear separation between data and process
objects is not exclusive of CLAM but can be found more or less explicitly
in different environments reviewed in chapter <A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A>.
See for instance the clear separation between <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual processors</SPAN>
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual data</SPAN> in the VDSP framework in section <A HREF="node56.html#sub:VDSP">2.2</A>.
Each of this categories forms an abstract class of the DSPOOM Metamodel.
Thus, a particular model, instance of the metamodel cannot instantiate
objects of this class directly but instances of the subclasses related
to the model under study.

<P>
Therefore, and simplifying the four-category metamodel, a DSPOOM based
model can be viewed as a set of Processing objects deployed as an
interconnected network. Each Processing can retrieve Processing Data
tokens and modify them according to some algorithm. Programmers can
keep control over the Processing Data flow between Processing or they
can delegate this task to one of the many possible automated Flow
Control schedulers. When a set of Processing objects is arranged they
form a new processing. Thus the new processing can be used as an abstraction
of the whole composition. DSPOOM Processings are compositional and
scalable. Processing objects can be grouped on compile-time as Processing
Composites, or dynamically on run-time as Networks.

<P>
DSPOOM is first, and above all, and object-oriented metamodel. Nevertheless,
and as a consequence of applying good object-oriented practices, a
graphical model of computation very much related to Process Networks
and Actor-Orientation has emerged (see section <A HREF="node34.html#sec:GraphicalMoCs">1.5</A>
for an overview of this technology).

<P>
After this first introduction we will first present the main two metaclasses
(i.e. Processing and Processing Data) in more detail. We will then
present the composition capabilities of the framework. In the next
sections we will analyze the object-oriented features of the metamodel
and will relate it to existing graphical models of computation.
