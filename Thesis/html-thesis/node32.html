MPEG-7
</H2>

<P>
The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is a working group of ISO/IEC
in charge of the development of international standards for compression,
decompression, processing, and coded representation of moving pictures,
audio and their combination. 

<P>
So far MPEG has produced (or is about to produce) the following standards: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>MPEG-1, the standard for storage and retrieval of moving pictures
and audio on storage media (approved Nov. 1992), includes in its layer
3 the famous mp3 format.
</LI>
<LI>MPEG-2, the standard for digital television (approved Nov. 1994),
includes most of the formats now used in DVD's.
</LI>
<LI>MPEG-4, the standard for multimedia applications (first version approved
in 1998) includes DiVX, AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) and Structured
Audio.
</LI>
<LI>MPEG-7 the content representation standard for multimedia information
search, filtering, management and processing (approved in 2002). 
</LI>
<LI>MPEG-21, the multimedia framework (still to be approved).
</LI>
</UL>
We will now focus in describing the main features of the MPEG-7 standard
not only as an example of metadata usage but also due to its relation
with different parts of this thesis and also because of our involvement
in its development process [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7InstrumentSoundDescriptionICMC">Peeters et&nbsp;al., 2000</A>].

<P>
The MPEG-7 standard [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7Book">Manjunath et&nbsp;al., 2002</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#MPEG7Overview">Mart&#237;nez, 2002</A>] also known as
&#34;Multimedia Content Description Interface&#34; aims
at providing standardized core technologies allowing description of
audiovisual data content in multimedia environments. In order to achieve
this broad goal, MPEG-7 has standardized: 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Descriptors (D) or representations of Features, that define the syntax
and the semantics of each feature representation, 
</LI>
<LI>Description Schemes (DS), that specify the structure and semantics
of the relationships between their components, which may be both Ds
and DSs,
</LI>
<LI>A Description Definition Language (DDL), to allow the creation of
new DSs and, possibly, Ds and to allows the extension and modification
of existing DSs,
</LI>
<LI>System tools, to support multiplexing of description, synchronization
issues, transmission mechanisms, file format, etc.
</LI>
</OL>
The MPEG-7 standard consists of the following parts, under the general
title Information Technology - Multimedia Content Description Interface:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Part 1: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Systems</SPAN>. Architecture of the standard, tools that are
needed to prepare MPEG-7 Descriptions for efficient transport and
storage, and to allow synchronization between content and descriptions.
Also tools related to managing and protecting intellectual property.
</LI>
<LI>Part 2: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Description Definition Language</SPAN> (DDL). Language for
defining new DSs and perhaps eventually also for new Ds, binary representation
of DDL expressions.
</LI>
<LI>Part 3: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Visual</SPAN>. Visual elements (Ds and DSs).
</LI>
<LI>Part 4: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Audio</SPAN>. Audio elements (Ds and DSs).
</LI>
<LI>Part 5: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Multimedia Description Schemes</SPAN>. Elements (Ds and DSs)
that are generic, i.e. neither purely visual nor purely audio. 
</LI>
<LI>Part 6: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Reference Software</SPAN>. Software implementation of relevant
parts of the MPEG-7 Standard.
</LI>
<LI>Part 7: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Conformance</SPAN>. Guidelines and procedures for testing
conformance of MPEG-7 implementations.
</LI>
</UL>
The following terminology plays a major role in the understanding
of the MPEG-7 process: 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Data</SPAN>: Data is audio-visual information that will be described
using MPEG-7, regardless of storage, coding, display, transmission,
medium, or technology. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Feature</SPAN>: A Feature is a distinctive characteristic of the data
which signifies something to somebody. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Descriptor</SPAN>: A Descriptor (D) is a representation of a Feature.
A Descriptor defines the syntax and the semantics of the Feature representation. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Descriptor Value</SPAN>: A Descriptor Value is an instantiation of
a Descriptor for a given data set (or subset thereof). 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Description Scheme</SPAN>: A Description Scheme (DS) specifies the
structure and semantics of the relationships between its components,
which may be both Descriptors and Description Schemes. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Description</SPAN>: A Description consists of a DS (structure) and
the set of Descriptor Values (instantiations) that describe the Data. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Coded Description</SPAN>: A Coded Description is a Description that
has been encoded to fulfil relevant requirements such as compression
efficiency, error resilience, random access, etc. 

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Description Definition Language</SPAN>: The Description Definition
Language (DDL) is a language that allows the creation of new Description
Schemes and, possibly, Descriptors. It also allows the extension and
modification of existing Description Schemes. 

<P>
The main tools used to implement MPEG-7 descriptions are the Description
Definition Language (DDL), Description Schemes (DSs), and Descriptors
(Ds). Descriptors bind a feature to a set of values. Description Schemes
are models of the multimedia objects and of the universes that they
represent e.g. the data model of the description. They specify the
types of the descriptors that can be used in a given description,
and the relationships between these descriptors or between other Description
Schemes. 

<P>
In this context the DDL defines the syntactic rules to express descriptions
schemes and their interpretation. MPEG-7's DDL is based on an extension
of W3s XML-Schema. However, the DDL is not a modeling language such
as UML. The DDL is rather to be used to represent the result of modeling,
i.e. DS and Ds. Here is an example of an MPEG-7 definition of an image:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="391" HEIGHT="494" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\texttt{\footnotesize &lt;Creation&gt;}{\footnotesize\par
}
\par
...
... &lt;/Creation&gt;}&nbsp;\\
\texttt{\footnotesize }&nbsp;\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
The Experimental Model (XM) software is the simulation platform for
the MPEG-7 descriptors (Ds), description schemes (DSs), coding schemes
(CSs), and description definition language (DDL). Besides the normative
components, the simulation platform needs also some non-normative
components, essentially to execute some procedural code to be executed
on the data structures. The data structures and the procedural code
together form the applications. The XM applications are divided in
two types: the server applications and the client applications. 

<P>
The server applications are used to extract the descriptor data from
the media data. The extracted descriptor data is coded and written
to an MPEG-7 bit stream. The client application performs the search
in the MPEG-7 coded database, by computing the distance between the
query descriptor and all reference descriptor of the database. Therefore,
one descriptor, the query descriptor, is extracted in the same way
as in the server application except that the coding is not performed.
The reference descriptors are all extracted from the MPEG-7 bit stream. 

<P>
The truth is that in its current state the Experimental Model is far
from useful due to its complexity, lack of completeness and mixed
approaches. It is our opinion that more efforts should be put into
it. As a matter of fact, a standard such as MPEG7 would benefit from
being an extensible software framework instead of just a set of tools
and definitions.
