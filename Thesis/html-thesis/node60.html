or MusicAl Research SYStem for Analysis and Synthesis is a framework
for experimenting, evaluating and integrating techniques for audio
content analysis. Although the name includes the word Synthesis, Marsyas'
focus is clearly on sound analysis tools and information retrieval
techniques. The framework allows to integrate these tools using a
semi-automatic approach and a graphical interface. On the other hand
Marsyas is released under the GPL license and is therefore Free Software.

<P>
In order to come up with a valid model for Marsyas, different algorithms
and techniques were studied and common behavior and features were
abstracted. OO programming techniques were used to implement abstract
classes that provide a common API for the building blocks of the system
and inheritance is used to factor out common operations.

<P>
The environment is able to combine traditional bottom-up processing
(from signal to metadata) as well as top-down (according to the author
prediction-driven, for instance, has proven to be interesting). Although
the objects form a natural bottom-up hierarchy, top-down flow of information
can be expressed in the framework (e.g. a silence feature can be used
by an iterator for music/speech to avoid calculating features on silent
frames).

<P>
The framework design is based on a client-server architecture. The
server is written in C++ and contains all the signal processing and
pattern recognition algorithms, optimized for performance. The client
is written in Java, contains only the graphical interface and communicates
with the server using sockets. Both the server and the client run
on Solaris, SGI, Linux and Windows.

<P>
The main classes of the system can roughly be divided into process-like
and data-structure-like.

<P>
The Process-like classes can be divided in the following categories:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Transformations</SPAN> are low-level signal processing units used
by the system. They take as input a frame of sound samples and output
a transformation of that frame (e.g. power spectral density, caepstrum,
windowing...)
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Features</SPAN> process a frame of sound samples and output a vector
which unlike transformations is reduced significantly in dimensionality.
More than one ``physical'' feature can be combined in a single
vector.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Memories</SPAN> are circular buffers that hold previously calculated
features for a limited time. They are used to compute means and variances
of features over large windows.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Iterators</SPAN> break up a sound stream into frames. For each frame
they use memories and features to compute a feature vector. The time-series
of feature vectors is called the feature map. Typically there is a
different iterator for each classification scheme (e.g. silence/non
silence iterator uses only energy as a feature and no memories, the
music/speech iterator uses 9 features and 2 memories (of different
sizes).
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Classifiers</SPAN> take as input a feature vector and output its estimated
class. They are trained using labeled feature maps.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Segmentators</SPAN> take as input feature maps and output a signal
with peaks corresponding to segmentation boundaries.
</LI>
</UL>
Data structure classes can in turn be categorized in:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Vectors</SPAN> are the basic data components of the system. They are
float arrays tagged with sizes. Operator overloading is used for vector
operations to avoid writing many nested loops for signal processing
code. The operators are inlined and optimized and the resulting code
is easy to read without compromising performance. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Sound data</SPAN> contain samples of audio as vectors with header
information such as sample rate or channels.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Feature maps</SPAN> are time-series of feature vectors. They can be
class labeled for evaluation and training.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Time regions</SPAN> are time intervals tagged with annotation information.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Time lines</SPAN> are lists of time regions.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Time trees</SPAN> are arbitrary trees of time regions. They represent
a hierarchical decomposition of audio into successively smaller segments.
</LI>
</UL>
All objects contain methods to read/write them to file and transport
them using the socket interface.

<P>
Implemented features in the framework include spectral centroid, spectral
moments, spectral flux, pitch, harmonicity, mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC), linear prediction (LPC) reflection coefficients,
zero crossings, RMS, and spectral rolloff. For all of them means,
variances and higher-order statistics can be computed using memories.
New features can be easily added by just writing the code for computing
the feature over a frame of samples.

<P>
Two classifiers have been implemented: the Gaussian (MAP) classifier
and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). 

<P>
Different applications such as music/speech discriminator have been
implemented in order to test the architecture. 

<P>
The user interface looks like a typical tape-recorder wave editor
but in addition it allows skipping by either user-defined fixed duration
blocks or time lines containing regions of different duration.

<P>
At the moment of this writing Marsyas is going an overall rewrite
towards a 0.2 version of the framework.
