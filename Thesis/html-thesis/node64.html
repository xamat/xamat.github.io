Open Sound World (OSW)
</H3>

<P>
Open Sound World (OSW) [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ChaudrayOSW">Chaudhary et&nbsp;al., 1999</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-OSW">www-OSW, </A>] is a scalable,
extensible programming environment that allows to process sound in
response to expressive real-time control. OSW combines the familiar
visual patching paradigm with solid programming-language features
such as a strong type system and hierarchical name spaces and an intuitive
model for specifying new components. OSW is also highly dynamic and
allows users to both edit <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transforms</SPAN> and manipulate performance
controls simultaneously, run audio signals at several rates simultaneously
and change patches or the basic configuration even while the audio
is running.

<P>
OSW allows development of audio applications using patching, C++,
high-level specifications and scripting. New components can be expressed
using familiar mathematical constructs without a deep knowledge of
C++ programming and the processed data can have any valid C++ type.
OSW uses a reactive real-time scheduler that safely and efficiently
handles multiple processors, time sources, and synchronous dataflows.

<P>
OSW is a dataflow programming language: users connect primitive components
to form a network. Each component accepts data, processes and sends
it back to the network. OSW is also an OO language because components
are instances of classes that specify their behavior. OSW employs
a visual programming environment that allows users to instantiate
and connect graphical representations of components. 

<P>
Primitive components in OSW are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transforms</SPAN>. They accept
data through their <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inlets</SPAN>, and produce results in their <SPAN  CLASS="textit">outlets</SPAN>.
For instance, in OSW an oscillator is a transform with two inlets
(timeIn and frequency) and one outlet (samplesOut). Transforms can
be very simple or extremely complex. Because computations are more
efficient between a single transform, complex ones are often favored 

<P>
Transforms can be connected to form larger networks called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patches</SPAN>
which are themselves also transforms. Connections are strongly typed
and each outlet is connected at most at one inlet. In order to connect
one outlet to different inlets a special FanOut transform must be
used. The same way, one inlet must only be connected to one outlet
or else use the FanIn transform.

<P>
The work in transforms is done inside <SPAN  CLASS="textit">activation expressions.</SPAN>
An activation expression is a piece of C++ code that is executed when
certain inlet or state variable is modified. If the expression depends
on more than one input variable, all of them must be modified in order
to trigger the expression and then the activation can be executed
immediately or be delayed for a previously specified amount of time.
The result of an activation expression is usually assigned to one
or more outlets. Whenever an outlet is assigned a new value, this
value is sent to the connected inlet; if the receiving transform is
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">active</SPAN> it will respond with an activation expression, if it
is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">passive</SPAN> the value is assigned to the inlet but no further
processing occurs.

<P>
OSW provides a set of primitive data types (integers, floating point...)
as well as some useful datatypes for music and signal processing such
as samples (as floating point or integer numbers), frequency domain
spectra, notes, MIDI events, and SDIF. It is relatively easy to add
new data types as C++ classes. OSW uses a hierarchical namespace that
can be used to reference instances or variables (e.g. ``/sinewaveplayer1/sinewave/frequency'').
In a similar way transform classes are grouped into packages PackageName::Transform.

<P>
The Get and Set transform can be used to query and modify variables
by their pathname. They are similar to the ``goto'' in structured
programming. Its expressive power is that you can break the dataflow
model and access variables in a transform that is not connected. Abusing
of such feature though may make the resulting program hard to read
and debug.

<P>
OSW provides abstractions for the input/output devices as well as
transforms for communicating with them. OSW supports audio hardware,
MIDI I/O, Ethernet and serial ports. It can also be extended to support
additional devices such as graphics tablets.

<P>
Some transforms include outlets of type <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> that can be connected
to any kind of inlet. Every time a new data is sent from the outlet
to the connected inlet, it must be checked if it is a compatible type.
The use of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> is inefficient and seldom used (usually only
for <TT>Get</TT> and <TT>Set</TT> on global or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">free</SPAN> variables).
On the other hand some transforms include <SPAN  CLASS="textit">dynamically typed
inlets</SPAN> that are assigned a type at connection time. These transforms
though do not introduce any run-time efficiency penalty and they are
used for polymorphic operations such as arithmetic operators.

<P>
In dataflow languages for signal processing several copies of the
same connected transforms are often done (e.g. for multichannel processing).
OSW offers a different abstraction (apart from the obvious of creating
a separate patch): transform arrays. An <TT>Array</TT> transform takes
a transform class name, an integer, an instance name and arguments
for the transform class and makes a single object containing n copies
of the transform.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Bundles</SPAN> are an abstraction of buses in audio engineering, they
are used to transmit n data objects over a single connection (especially
useful in <TT>Array</TT> connections). Special transforms are used
in order to convert to an form bundles.

<P>
Transforms are implemented in C++ while the graphical interface is
implemented in Tcl/Tk and Tcl scripting is also used for defining
patches. OSW offers an extensible object-oriented model that allows
users to develop at different levels including visual patching, high-level
C++ and Tcl scripting. Users can provide C++ code or Tcl script to
override the default behavior of the transform in the graphical environment.

<P>
OSW includes a tool called the ``Externalizer'' that automatically
converts a high-level specification into efficient C++ code. The code
is then compiled and can be loaded into the OSW environment. The Externalizer
presents a transform as a collection of inlets, outlets, state variables
and activation expressions that the user can modify. The externalizer
also allows to define new data types to be used for transform variables
(a conversion to string must be included).

<P>
Expert programmers can bypass the Externalizer and write the transforms
in C++ directly deriving from one the base transform classes: Transform
or TimeDomainTransform. All derived classes include members for inlets,
outlets, state variables and activations, a member function for each
activation and a constructor.

<P>
OSW allows users to write familiar mathematical expressions instead
of hand optimized C++ code, this is accomplished through the use of
operator overloading and the osw::vector class. 

<P>
OSW is designed for implementing <SPAN  CLASS="textit">reactive real-time</SPAN> audio and
music applications. Reactive real-time involves maintaining output
quality while minimizing <SPAN  CLASS="textit">latency</SPAN>, delay between input and output
of the system, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">jitter</SPAN> (change of latency over time). In
OSW there is also a notion of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">real time</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual time</SPAN>.
Real time is a quantity that increases at a fixed rate as measured
by a clock while virtual time can be scaled or translated (e.g. tempo
changing, fast-forward...). 

<P>
An audio output device is a transform that has only state variables
and no inputs or outputs and is not part of any patch but can be accessed
using Get and Set. The output device controls when the transforms
produce the samples by controlling the device clock. When the clock
is updated it triggers the queue of activations, evaluating those
scheduled to occur in that time.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Synchronous</SPAN> transforms are those that produce samples as a
function of virtual time. Activation expressions are guaranteed to
occur exactly once each period of the clock to which the transform
is synchronized. The order in which they are executed within a period
is also fixed. This is true of more general <SPAN  CLASS="textit">synchronous dataflow
graphs</SPAN>. Because OSW allows multiple audio devices and clock sources,
several synchronous dataflow graphs that run at different sample rates
and buffer sizes are supported.

<P>
Unlike transforms in the synchronous chains, the relative execution
times of asynchronous transforms (events coming from GUI or MIDI device)
cannot be predicted. Some inlets and state variables that are sensible
to asynchronous updates must be protected. (e.g. If the coefficients
of the filters are updated asynchronously the filter may become unstable)
This protection is included in the more general parallel scheduler
as asynchronous events are a special case of parallelism.

<P>
OSW is designed to take advantage of multi-processor capabilities.
Given enough processors, each transform could be executed on a different
processor, executing whenever its inlets or state variables change,
but processor utilization would be poor.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">chain</SPAN> is a set of connected transforms in which no outlet
or inlet in the chain is connected to a transform not in the chain.
A chain has no branches. It is said to be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">maximal chain</SPAN> if
no other chain can contain it (i.e. if we add another transform it
will no longer be a chain). Maximal chains must be scheduled sequentially
while separate maximal chains can run in parallel. They are considered
the formal unit of parallel computation in OSW. Deferred deallocation
can be performed between execution calls to maximal chains or in a
low-priority separate thread.

<P>
OSW provides methods for locking and unlocking variables. When a value
is written onto a locked variable they are placed in a buffer and
assigned to the variable only when this is unlocked (this technique
is known as double buffering).

<P>
OSW supports networking. Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for
high-level control of sound synthesis and other applications. It divides
the world into clients that generate control messages and servers
that produce sound. OSW is a natural server for OSC.

<P>
OSW also supports the SDIF format and OSW patches are tcl scripts
that can be downloaded and executed in a browser with a plug-in.
