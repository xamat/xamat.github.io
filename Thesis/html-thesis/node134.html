Summary and Conclusions</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this chapter we present the CLAM framework. This software framework
is a comprehensive environment for developing audio and music applications.
It may be also used as a research platform for the same domain. CLAM
can be seen both as the origin and the prove of concept of the conceptual
models and metamodels that are included in this thesis.

<P>
CLAM is written in C++, it is efficient, object-oriented, and cross-platform.
It presents a clean and clear design result of applying thorough software
engineering techniques. The framework can be used as a black-box,
relying on the offered <SPAN  CLASS="textit">repository</SPAN>, or as a white-box framework,
extending its functionality through its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">infrastructure</SPAN>.

<P>
CLAM's repository is made up of a large collection of signal processing
algorithms encapsulated as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing</SPAN> classes and a number
of data structures included in its <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing Data</SPAN> repository.
The Processing repository basically includes algorithms for signal
analysis, synthesis and transformation. Furthermore it also includes
encapsulated platform and system-level tools such as audio and MIDI
input/audio both in streaming and file mode. On the other hand the
Processing Data repository offers those data types that are needed
as inputs or outputs of the processing algorithms. These include classes
such as Audio, Spectrum or Fundamental Frequency. It also includes
a collection of statistical <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Descriptors</SPAN> that can be obtained
from the basic Processing Data objects.

<P>
On the other hand CLAM's infrastructure offers ways of extending the
already existing repository by deriving new Processing or Processing
data classes. In the case of Processing classes this is accomplished
by a simple inheritance mechanism in which the user is forced to implement
some particular behavior in his/her concrete Processing class. Mechanisms
for composing with Processing objects, handling input and output data
through <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ports</SPAN> and control data through <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Controls</SPAN> are
also offered. The Processing Data Infrastructure is based on CLAM's
Dynamic Types. This is a special C++ class that, using macros and
template metaprogramming techniques, offers a very simple way of creating
data containers with a homogeneous interface and automatic services
such as introspection or passivation facilities. CLAM's infrastructure
is completed by a set of tools for platform abstraction, such as audio
and MIDI or multithreading handling mechanisms, a cross-platform toolkit-independent
visualization module, XML serialization facilities or application
skeletons.

<P>
CLAM also offers a number of usage examples and ready-to-use applications.
These applications include SMSTools, a graphical environment for audio
analysis/synthesis/transformation, and Salto, a spectral-sample based
sax and trumpet synthesizer. Another important application is the
Network Editor, a graphical tool for creating CLAM Networks using
a graphical boxes-and-connections metaphor ala Max. This application
can be used as a rapid prototyping and research tool. But CLAM has
also been used in many other internal projects for instance for developing
a voice processing VST plugin, a high-quality time-stretching algorithm
or content-based analysis applications.

<P>
CLAM can be compared to some other frameworks presented in chapter
<A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A>. After the discussion in section
<A HREF="node130.html#sec:IsCLAMDifferent">3.3</A>, and using the different information that
we have gathered in it, we will now build a comparison table as a
conclusion for this chapter. For doing so we will use some of the
features that we most value about CLAM and we think are essential
of any framework. A framework that may aim at substituting CLAM should
be :

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Comprehensive</SPAN>. It should offer a complete infrastructure
and tools for audio and music analysis, processing and synthesis.
Furthermore, it should offer tools for object passivation, visualization
or input/output of any kind of audio and music source. 
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Cross-platform</SPAN>. It should be fully portable at least across
major operating systems and platforms.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Free/Open Source</SPAN>. It should be at least Open Source and preferably
Free in the sense defined by the Free Software Foundation (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#FSF">Free Software Foundation, </A>]).
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Active</SPAN>. In order to be successful a software framework must
be active and have a community that offers support and feedback.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Complete software framework</SPAN>. It should be usable as a white-box
/ black-box framework but should also offer a visual builder or similar
tool.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Efficient</SPAN>. Any usable framework for audio processing should
have efficiency as one of its fundamental goals.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Well-implemented</SPAN>. The framework should be implemented in
C++ as this is the best suited language for our purposes. Furthermore,
it should use good coding practices and design principles such as
Design Patters and the like.
</LI>
</OL>
Taking those features into account we in Table <A HREF="#tab:Comparing-CLAM-to">3.1</A>
we summarize how the environments most closely related to CLAM stand
the comparison with our framework.

As a final conclusion it is important to mention that although CLAM
has already proven useful, it is well designed and presents many interesting
features, it is success is not guaranteed. The success of a framework
depends on many internal but also external factors. In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#ScalettiKyma2002">Scaletti, 2002</A>],
Carla Scaletti outlines the most important factors that (``apart
from the lucky accidents'') will make a computer music language successful.
These are applicable extensible to not only computer music languages
but also any kind of music related environment. We will reproduce
the complete list as a conclusion for this chapter:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Reasons intrinsic to the language. A language is successful...

<P>

<UL>
<LI>if people are using successfully

<P>

<UL>
<LI>if it answers a need that is not otherwise satisfied
</LI>
<LI>if it is able to express the unanticipated
</LI>
<LI>if its underlying data structure can support extensions and multiple
interpretations without violating the original model
</LI>
<LI>if its authors can strike a balance between providing users with what
they say they need and what they do not yet know that they need.
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Reasons extrinsic to the language. A language is successful...

<P>

<UL>
<LI>if one can learn it and learn from it
</LI>
<LI>when it has a community of users
</LI>
<LI>when it serves as a nexus for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization
</LI>
<LI>when its author uses it regularly
</LI>
<LI>when the people behind it are committed to its success.
</LI>
<LI>when people are ready for it
</LI>
<LI>when people say it is successful
</LI>
<LI>sometimes due to pure luck
</LI>
<LI>if it has contributed ideas and stimulated new developments in the
field.
</LI>
<LI>A language cannot be successful unless it first exists
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
