What is Content?
</H2>

<P>
The term content processing has already been around for a few years
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#KarjalainenImmersionAndContent">Karjalainen, 1999</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#ChiariglioneValueContent">Chiariglione, 2000</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#CamurriMusicContentProcessing">Camurri, 1999</A>]
but its meaning is still unclear and a matter of controversy. When
we talk about content analysis, content browsing, content indexing,
content processing or content transformation we are usually addressing
the higher-level information that a signal produced by an audiovisual
source carries within.

<P>
Even though the previous pseudo-definition is conservative in its
scope, it already includes a crucial and sometimes polemical term:
higher-level. It is true that this label assumes that it is being
compared to something else, and this something else is usually the
signal processing level. Even so, what about semantic features that
can (more or less directly) be extracted from the actual signal? Is
color a low-level descriptor or a high-level semantic feature of a
visual object? Should we consider pitch as a higher-level feature
as opposite to its signal-processing counterpart, fundamental frequency?
How can we distinguish between the abstraction level implied by some
perceptual feature like loudness and some other with more semantic
load such as genre?

<P>
It is our opinion that for deciding whether something is content or
not we must address its functional value. Therefore we will use the
word content for any piece of information related to the audio source
that is in any way meaningful (that it carries semantic information)
to the targeted user. Thus, the description of that content can be
thought of as a content hierarchy with different levels of abstraction,
any of them potentially useful for some users. In that sense, think
of how different would a content description of a song be if the targeted
user was a naive listener or an expert musicologist. Even a low-level
descriptor such as the spectral envelope of a signal can be thought
of as a particular level of content description targeted for the signal
processing engineer. We subscribe the already commented definition
of a descriptor in MPEG7 as ``a distinctive characteristic of the
data which signifies something to somebody''.

<P>
In the next sections we will also see how our idea of content fits
well into an object-oriented metamodel.
