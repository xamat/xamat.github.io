Graphical Models of Computation 
</H1>

<P>
Models of Computation (MoC's) are abstract representations of a family
of related computer-based systems. Although the word ``model''
will be kept for consistency with existing literature, it is clear
that following the definitions given in the previous sections, the
word ``metamodel'' would be much more appropriate. A MoC offers
a particular abstract vision with a particular purpose that can be
instantiated to model many different systems. Using the proper model
of computation improves the development process and yields a better
understanding of the system under design and its properties. Selecting
the appropriate model of computation depends on the purpose but the
choice is also generally conditioned by the application domain: DSP
applications, for instance, will generally benefit from Dataflow models
while control-intensive application mostly use Finite State Machine
or similar models.

<P>
General design paradigms such as object-oriented, functional or logic
may be interpreted as being models of computations. Nevertheless,
such paradigms are still too abstract and generic to be really useful
as a model of computation. As a matter of fact, a single paradigm
may be used to model different models of computations and a single
model of computation may be well consist on applying different general
purpose paradigms. After having decided to use the object-oriented
paradigm, much work in this thesis will be on finding the most appropriate
Model of Computation it is therefore important to first understand
what are the ones most related to our domain of interest.

<P>
Most useful models of computation belong to the category of ``graphical
MoC's''. By <SPAN  CLASS="textit">graphical</SPAN> we are expressing the fact that according
to the model, the system being modeled can be explicitly specified
by a graph, being a graph a general mathematical construct formed
by ``arcs'' and ``nodes''. Many MoC's are obtained by assigning
a concrete semantic to arcs and nodes and by restricting the general
structure of the graph (see figure <A HREF="#fig:Graph">1.2</A>). A non-exhaustive
list of graphical MoC's includes: Queueing Models, Finite State Machines,
State Charts, Petri Nets, Process Networks and Dataflow Networks<A NAME="tex2html6"

Although the rest of this section will give a more detailed view of
the models of interest, we will now briefly give a description of
each of these models in order to have a first general overview:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Queueing Models is a graphical model where nodes represent complex
operators such as Poisson queues or decision nodes and arcs represent
events/tokens/requests. They are used for performance estimation,
like determining the total latency of a network of queueing nodes.
</LI>
<LI>Finite State Machines <SPAN ID="txt815"></SPAN>are especially useful for specifying
sequential control in control-intensive tasks and protocols. An FSM
graph is made up of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inputs</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">outputs</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">states</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">initial state</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">next state</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">outs</SPAN>. The model
is not Turing complete and it renders models that are more suitable
for formal analysis. 
</LI>
<LI>State Charts is a graphical model consisting on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">states</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">events</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">conditions</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">actions</SPAN>. Events and conditions cause
transitions and there are AND and OR compositions of states.
</LI>
<LI>Petri Nets is a graphical model for describing and studying systems
with concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, non-deterministic, and
parallel characteristics. It consists of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">places</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transitions</SPAN>
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">arcs</SPAN> that connect them. A Petri net is executed by the
firing rules that transmit the marks or tokens from one place to another
and such firing is enabled just when each input place has a token
inside.
</LI>
<LI>Process Networks or Kahn Process Networks is a concurrent model of
computation that is a superset of data flow models. As a directed
graph, each arc represents a FIFO queue for communication and each
node represents an independent, concurrent process.
</LI>
<LI>Dataflow Networks is a special case of Process Networks where nodes
are actors that respond to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">firing rules</SPAN>.
</LI>
</UL>
We will now describe the last three of these models for their relation
to the CLAM network model.
