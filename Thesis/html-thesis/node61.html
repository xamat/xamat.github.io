Maaate
</H3>

<P>
Maaate is an audio analysis toolkit that supports the extraction of
structure and content of MPEG-encoded audio files as well as raw files.
Maaate was implemented by Silvia Pfeiffer and other researchers of
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO),
Mathematical and Information Sciences (CMIS) in Australia. It is offered
as Free Software under the GPL license for GNU/Linux and Windows.
Maaate is implemented in C++ but a C wrapper interface is also offered.
The framework is functional but not updated regularly, with the author's
focus turning in other directions.

<P>
There are several reasons for which the authors justify the use of
MPEG encoded files. First, MPEG is a de facto standard not only for
internet audio for also for audio encoding in video formats. Second,
the encoding process usually removes non-perceivable sounds that are
not interesting either for content description applications. And finally,
MPEG encoded files already have frequency domain information that
can be used to extract some descriptors more easily and efficiently
as the library allows to access directly the fields of the MPEG encoded
file without having to decode it.

<P>
Apart for the general infrastructure, Maaate also includes modules
with analysis algorithms such as loudness approximation, segmentation,
silence or background noise level.

<P>
Maaate's architecture allows to easily add new algorithms. It is designed
in tiers in order to separate functionalities and offer a cleaner
API.

<P>
Tier 1 is in charge of parsing MPEG streams and offers access to the
encoded fields. The most important class in this tier is the MPEGfile
class.

<P>
Tier 2 offers two generic data containers (<TT>SegmentData</TT> and
<TT>SegmentTable</TT>) that can be used from the analysis modules.
<TT>SegmentData</TT>: contains analysis data for one segment (continuous
time range) of the audio file. A <TT>SegmentTable</TT> contains a
collection of segment of an audio file. These segments are ordered
by their start time. Tier 2 also offers a module interface to plugin
analysis routines that are stored in dynamic libraries. By using the
offered plugin interface modules can be developed and compiled separately
from Maaate and the toolkit can be extended without ever having to
recompile it. The boundary between Maaate and the analysis modules
is explicit so the author can clearly keep his/her authorship.

<P>
A module is simply a collection of related functions that offer a
particular functionality. Modules that analyze content usually collect
information on several MPEG audio frames and calculate information
from these. Tier 2 was constructed for such modules but other kinds
are also possible. Modules can be broadly classified into feature
extraction, feature analysis and content analysis. Feature extraction
modules make use of tier 1 access functions and store the result in
tier 2 containers. Feature analysis modules use the already extracted
features for further (usually statistical) analysis such as clustering
or segmentation. Finally content analysis modules calculate higher
level information such as silence/music/speech discrimination using
feature extraction and analysis modules and storing the result in
convenience containers.

<P>
A module is in fact an instance of the Module class, which also offers
convenience functions to access the information, handle parameters,
check constraints, and call the module functions. The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">apply</SPAN>
method contains the implementation of all the analysis functionality,
taking a list of parameters as input and producing another list of
parameters as output. 

<P>
Any module must offer an appropriate constructor and a function to
add itself to the list of available modules. The other important operations
present in the Module class and all its subclasses are the following:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>init</TT> (required): sets up basic module information (name,
author...) and the input/output parameter specification.
</LI>
<LI><TT>default</TT> (required): sets default values for input parameters
and returns the parameter list.
</LI>
<LI><TT>suggest</TT> (optional, recommended): takes an input parameter
list, suggests parameter values based on information from other parameters
and changes constraints on input parameters.
</LI>
<LI><TT>reset</TT> (optional): resets a module by reseting internal processing
information or parameter values.
</LI>
<LI><TT>apply</TT> (required): takes an input parameter list, performs
the analysis function and returns the calculated output parameters.
</LI>
<LI><TT>destroy</TT> (optional): cleans up allocated memory and deletes
parameter specification.
</LI>
</UL>
A parameter is an instance of the <TT>ModuleParam</TT> class. The
<TT>init</TT> function sets up the list of input/output parameter
specification and the application calls the <TT>default</TT> function
to set default values. From there on, the input parameters may be
modified by the application. It can also call the <TT>suggest</TT>
function at any time for filling-in necessary parameter values and
constraints and performing sanity checks. Finally, the application
may then call the <TT>apply</TT> function, which first checks for
parameters to be within the constraints.

<P>
There is a short list of allowed simple or complex data types for
parameters. Basic types may be: boolean, integer, real and string
(all of them defined in Maaate with particular conditions). Complex
types may be: a pointer to an opened MPEG file, a pointer to a segment
data structure, or a pointer to a segment table. All of them have
their particular <TT>MAAATE_</TT> define.

<P>
There are three types of constraints: no constraints, a list of single
values that allow the parameter to take as value any on the list,
and a list of ranges according to which parameters may take any value
in any range on the list. A constraint is an instance of the <TT>ModuleParameterConstraint</TT>
class that can handle either single values or a single range. For
a single value there is usually a list of constraints realized by
instantiating the <TT>MaateConstraint</TT> class, a class that provides
functions for such things as adding constraints or checking whether
values satisfy them.

<P>
On the other hand, a parameter specification is an instance of the
<TT>ModuleParamSpec</TT> class, which contains the specification of
a single parameter. The specification consists of a name, a description,
a data type, default values and constraints.

<P>
The <TT>Plugins</TT> class provides functionality to load and unload
single modules and whole libraries, and administrates the list of
available modules. For building a shared library a function loadModules
must be supplied that instantiates the modules and returns their list
to Maaate. For dynamically loading modules into an application an
instance of the <TT>Plugins</TT> class must be declared and the particular
library must be loaded using the class' <TT>AddLibrary</TT> function.
Then the different loaded modules can be accessed with the <TT>GetModule(string)</TT>
function. 

<P>
Bewdy is a sample graphical application that demonstrates Maaate by
using a few of its modules. It runs on GNOME and needs the OSS sound
system.
