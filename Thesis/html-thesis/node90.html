NEXT MusicKit ScoreFile Language
</H3>

<P>
ScoreFile [<A
 HREF="node207.html#NextScoreFile">NeXT, 1990</A>] is a musical score language included
in the already commented Music Kit from NeXT Computer Inc. (see section
<A HREF="node72.html#sub:NeXT-Music-Kit">2.4</A>). A NeXT ScoreFile is a regular ASCII text
file that can be edited with any text editor.

<P>
A ScoreFile is divided in two sections: the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Header</SPAN> and the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Body</SPAN>. These two parts are divided by the reserved word BEGIN,
and the file ends when the END word or and EOF (regular end-of-file)
is found.

<P>
The Header is made up of different kinds of statements: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Score
Information</SPAN> Statements, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Part Statements</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Part Information
Declarations</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Range Statements</SPAN>. Score Information Statements
are used to assign values to global score parameters such as tempo
or sampling rate. Part Statements declare the names of the parts that
will be used throughout the score. Part Information Statements are
made up of the previously declared name and a collection of parameters.
And finally, Range Statements allow to define note ranges.

<P>
The Body consists on a sequence of time-ordered statements. These
statements are usually <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Temporal Statements</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Note Statements</SPAN>.
Temporal Statements specify a particular moment in which all the following
Note Statements will take place until the next Temporal Statement
is received. They use the following syntax:

<P>
t[+]expression

<P>
Where the reserved word ``t'' means the current time in musical
notation (0.0 at the beginning of the score). If the ``+'' sign
is included, current time is increased by the expression value, else
it will directly be assigned the value.

<P>
Every time a Note Statement is read, a ``note object'' is created.
A Note Statement is made up of the name of the part where it belongs,
a type and name declaration, and a list of parameters.

<P>
Finally, there are some Statements that can be included both in the
Header or the Body. These are: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Variable Declaration and Assignments</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Envelope Statements</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">WaveTable Statements</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Object
Statements</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Include Statements</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Printing Statements</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Tuning Statements</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Comment Statements</SPAN>. Variable
declaration and assignments follow syntax conventions of C language.
The available variable types are: double, int, string, env (envelopes),
wave, object, var (generic variable that can be of any type). Envelope
Statements allow to declare envelopes from a list of points and a
smoothing value. In the same way, WaveTable Statements are used to
declare a wave table from a list of partials with their frequency,
amplitude and (optionally) phase. Object Statements allow to add any
kind of user-defined object. Include Statements are useful to include
other scores into the current one while Print Statements include control
statements to use when printing out the document. Tuning Statements
are used for defining scales other than the temperate twelve tone
scale that is used by default.

<P>
The ScoreFile language has a number of operators for those statements
that need to use them in an expression. These operators include the
arithmetic ones plus a special list that adds dB computation, pitch
transposition or envelope computation.
