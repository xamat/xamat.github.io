Processing Objects
</H2>

<P>
We usually understand the verb ``to process'' as the action of
transforming some existing data. This transformation can be a change
in the data state or even its essence.

<P>
The DSPOOM Processing class is the abstract encapsulation of a process
following the object-oriented paradigm. We call any instance of a
Processing subclass a Processing object. Just as any object (see section
<A HREF="node8.html#sec:_Objects">1.1.1</A>) a Processing object has its own identity, behavior,
structure and sequence of valid states. A DSPOOM Processing object
is directly related to Processing objects in CLAM (see <A HREF="node111.html#sec:_ProcessingInfrastructure">3.2.2</A>)
but also to similar concepts in other environments. Therefore a DSPOOM
Processing object can be seen as an abstraction of Marsyas' <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transformations</SPAN>
(see <A HREF="node60.html#sub:Marsyas">2.3.1</A>), OSW's and Kyma's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">transforms</SPAN> (see
<A HREF="node64.html#sub:Open-Sound-World">2.3.2</A> and <A HREF="node76.html#sub:Kyma">2.5</A>), <SPAN  CLASS="textit">objects</SPAN> in
Max (see <A HREF="node77.html#sub:Max">2.5</A>) and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sound objects</SPAN> in SndObj (see <A HREF="node68.html#sub:SndObj">2.3.3</A>),
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">unit generators</SPAN> in CSL and Aura (see <A HREF="node67.html#sub:CSL">2.3.3</A> and <A HREF="node65.html#sub:W_Aura">2.3.2</A>),
STK's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN> (see <A HREF="node63.html#sub:STK">2.3.2</A>), <SPAN  CLASS="textit">processes</SPAN> in
FORMES (see <A HREF="node69.html#sub:FORMES">2.3.3</A>) or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual processors</SPAN> in VSDP
(see <A HREF="node56.html#sub:VDSP">2.2</A>).

<P>
The Processing objects are the main building blocks of a DSPOOM modeled
system. All processing in a DSPOOM model must be performed inside
a Processing object. While the Processing object is running it receives
and emits two kinds of output: synchronous data and asynchronous controls.

<P>
Figure <A HREF="#fig:DSPOOM-Processing-class">4.2</A> illustrates the different
concepts that are encapsulated in the Processing abstract class and
therefore in any concrete Processing object. Its main components are
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">configuration</SPAN>, incoming and outgoing data <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ports</SPAN>, incoming
and outgoing <SPAN  CLASS="textit">controls</SPAN> and any number of internal <SPAN  CLASS="textit">algorithms</SPAN>.
We will now introduce all of these concepts and the way they interrelate.

<P>
First though it is important to note that in a processing object we
define two different flows: from left to right we have the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">data
flow</SPAN> and from top to bottom we have the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">control flow</SPAN>. The
data flow is synchronous and thus controlled by an external clock.
The control flow is asynchronous and event-driven. We will come back
to the definition of different flows in section <A HREF="node140.html#sub:Data-and-Control_Flow">4.1.1</A>,
when we are a bit more familiar with the processing internal structure.

<P>
When triggering the process, we are asking the Processing object to
access some incoming data and, using the encapsulated algorithm(s),
transform it to some output data. A Processing object is able to access
external data through its connection Ports. Input ports, or Inports
for short, access incoming data and Output ports, or Outports, send
outgoing data. This same idea is found in other environments apart
from CLAM. Ports, for instance are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">inlets</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">outlets</SPAN>
in OSW and Max (see <A HREF="node64.html#sub:Open-Sound-World">2.3.2</A> and <A HREF="node77.html#sub:Max">2.5</A>)

<P>
Apart from the obvious interface for accessing encapsulated Processing
Data, Ports must offer connection facilities. Pairs of ports can be
connected as long as one of them is an Inport and the other and Outport
and meet a further condition: they are of the same Processing Data
type. Although this condition may be somehow relaxed by allowing connections
of polymorphic Processing Data Ports, this is not the recommended
nor the usual situation.

<P>
Besides receiving and sending data at a fixed rate through its Ports,
a Processing object may also receive asynchronous Control events.
These events affect the Processing object internal state and therefore
are able to influence the result of the process itself. The Processing
object can also broadcast these received events or some internally
generated ones through its output Controls.

<P>
But all this mechanisms can be seen as auxiliary to the processing
object main functionality, which is that of encapsulating one or more
particular algorithms that work towards a clearly defined purpose.
These algorithms are the ones actually in charge of transforming or
processing the input data. The selection of one of the maybe alternative
algorithms available is usually done upon configuration though some
particular processing objects may be able to implement an Strategy
pattern[<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>] for dynamically selecting one algorithm or the
other. Whether this policy is possible or not will depend, as in many
other situations, on whether a change in the algorithm means a structural
change or not. 

<P>
The execution of the Processing functionality is triggered by sending
it a Do message. This should be the only way to access a Processing
object functionality and the response to this message must be well
defined. On the other hand, dynamic changes (and by dynamic we mean
those that can be applied without the object having to transition
from one of the main states to the other) will be triggered by the
acknowledgement of an input control. The response of a Processing
object to a Do message depends on the values of the data in the input
ports but also on the internal state, which depends on the input controls
received.
