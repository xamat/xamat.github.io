Module data protocol</A>
</H3>

<P>
Collaborating modules pass data-blocks (payloads) but depending on
the application, the requirements for these payloads could be very
different: some may need asynchronous user events, some may have different
priority levels, some may contain large amounts of data. On the other
hand, sometimes the receiving module operates at a slower rate than
the transmitter, to avoid data loss the receiver must be able to determine
the flow control.

<P>
Besides, we must take into account a number of possible problems.
Large payloads make buffering very difficult. Payloads with time-sensitive
data have to be transferred in such a way that no deadlines are violated.
Asynchronous or priorized events are sent from one module to another-
Shared resources for inter-module communication might not be available
or the synchronization overhead not acceptable. And flow control has
to be determined by receiving module.

<P>
There are three basic ways to assign flow control among modules that
exchange Payloads:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Pull (functional): The downstream module requests information from
the upstream module with a method call that returns the values as
result. This mechanism can be implemented via a sequential protocol,
may be multithreaded and may process in-place. The receiving module
determines flow control. It is applicable in systems where the sender
operates faster than the receiver. This mechanism cannot deal with
asynchronous or priorized events.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Push</SPAN> (event driven): The upstream module issues a message whenever
new values are available. The mechanism can be implemented: as procedure
calls containing new data as arguments; as non-returning point to
point messages or broadcast; as priorized interrupts; or as continuation-style
program jumps. Usually the sending module does not know whether the
receiver is ready or not. To prevent data loss the receiver can have
a queue. If there are asynchronous or high-priority events, the queue
must let them pass, else a simple FIFO queue can do.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Indirect</SPAN> (shared resources): Requires a shared repository accessible
to both modules. When the sender is ready to pass a payload to the
receiver, it writes in the shared repository. When ready to process,
the receiver takes a payload from the repository. The sender and the
receiver can process at different rates. If not all the payloads are
required by the receiver, the upstream module can overwrite data.
</LI>
</UL>
It must be noted though that having more than one input port complicates
flow control and requires additional policies.
