Sample application
</H1>

<P>
In the previous sections we have presented examples of applications
that represent the implementation of a particular subset of the Object-Oriented
Content Transmission Metamodel or some of its components. We have
also a number of content-based transformations that in fact represent
a minor variation over the basic scheme. But in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#xamatAES">Amatriain and Herrera, 2001b</A>] we
presented a system to illustrate the whole OOCTM transmission chain.

<P>
The system was based on two already existing CLAM applications: SMSTools
and Salto (see section <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>). The basic idea
of the system is to transmit monophonic musical phrases by simply
transmitting an XML melody description. Figure <A HREF="#fig:OOCTM-Sample-Application">5.25</A>
illustrates the main components of the system and the basic data flow.

<P>

<P>
Note how this block diagram represents the complete OOCTM chain. In
our demo system the transmitter is basically the SMSTools application
with added melody description capabilities. The receiver is the Salto
saxophone synthesizer which was until then a real-time MIDI-controlled
synthesizer but to which we added the capability of understanding
XML melodies.

<P>
Just as it usually happens in these kinds of applications in our system
we can distinguish two different phases: initialization phase and
transmission phase.

<P>
In the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">initialization</SPAN> phase we have to construct and set
up the receiver. For doing so we have to take audio samples of isolated
notes, analyze them at the receiver and send them to the transmitter
as SMS spectral samples. The receiver will then organize them in a
local database and finally become ready to listen to incoming messages.
Note that in this sample system this initialization phase is rather
limited because the synthesizer that we have at the receiver is not
general enough. In this case we aimed at having a reasonable quality
and fidelity to the original encoded sound and that is still very
difficult to achieve with a generic synthesizer. Nevertheless, and
as a future line of work, it would in theory be possible to actually
transmit the complete description of the instrument using an instrument
description language such as MetriX's MIDL (see section <A HREF="node190.html#sub:MIDL">6.4.2</A>).
Then the idea would be to transmit both the spectral (or whatever
other kind) samples together with an XML description of how they should
be organized at the receiver. 

<P>
In the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">transmission</SPAN> phase the transmitter receives incoming
monophonic phrases and extracts the melodic description. For doing
so it uses a basic segmentation algorithm for identifying note boundaries
and assigns the analyzed energy and fundamental frequency to that
particular region (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#EmiliaMelodicTransformations">G&#243;mez et&nbsp;al., 2003b</A>] or [<A
 HREF="node207.html#EmiliaTabasco">G&#243;mez et&nbsp;al., 2003a</A>]
for more details on the algorithm being used and its implementation).
The melodic description is then encoded into XML, in an MPEG-7 like
manner and transmitted. The receiver then reads the XML melodic description,
decodes it and translates it into internal synthesis control data.
It finally synthesizes the output sound.
