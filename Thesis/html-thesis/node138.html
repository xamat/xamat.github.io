The Processing Object Lifecycle</A>
</H3>

<P>
As already stated in section <A HREF="node8.html#sec:_Objects">1.1.1</A>, the state of an
object is defined by the value of its attributes at a moment in time.
The sequence of states on an object define its lifecycle. Nevertheless,
not all variations on attribute values produce an important transition
in the lifecycle. That is why we talk about main states or supra states
and sub-states.

<P>
A Processing object lifecycle is made up of the following main states:
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Unconfigured</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ready</SPAN>, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Running</SPAN> (see figure
<A HREF="#fig:DSPOOM-Processing-state">4.4</A>). While in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Unconfigured</SPAN>
state the Processing object is waiting to be configured; in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ready</SPAN>
state it can be reconfigured or started; in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Running</SPAN> state,
once the Processing object has been configured and started, the actual
process can be executed; finally the Processing object can be stopped
in order to start the cycle again.

<P>

<P>
The messages that can be sent to a Processing object in order to change
its state are: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Configure</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Start</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Do</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Stop</SPAN>.
Any of these operations has a generic part and a concrete part that
is coupled to the concrete Processing class. The generic part of the
operation is in charge of controlling the state transitions and life
life cycle invariants. It is reasonable to think that the use of the
Template Method design pattern (see [<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>]) will offer an optimum
solution to this situation, implementing the commonalities in the
abstract Processing class and delegating any particular issues to
the concrete classes. We will now see how all these state transitions
affect a general Processing object.

<P>
The Processing object can only respond to the Configure message if
it is in the Unconfigured or Ready states. In any case if the configuration
that is passed is well-formed and valid the Processing object will
enter the Ready state, else it will stay or go to the Unconfigured
state. In this configuration process different internal operations
may take place:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Initialization of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">configuration variables</SPAN>, member variables
that contain parameters that are not supposed to change during the
execution phase.
</LI>
<LI>Initialization of internal tables that need to be allocated taking
into account some configuration parameter such as the size.
</LI>
</OL>
The Start message will only be acknowledged if the object is in the
Ready state and will produce a transition to the Running state. In
this transition, two activities are to take place:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Asserting that the Configuration process has taken place and left
the Processing object in a valid concrete Ready state.
</LI>
<LI>Initialization of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">execution variables</SPAN>. Execution member variables
are defined as those that are bound to change during execution and
they include items such as internal counters, timers or memories.
These execution variables also include input and output <SPAN  CLASS="textit">controls</SPAN>. 
</LI>
</OL>
A Processing object can only respond to the Do message and therefore
process when it is in the Running state. During this phase the Processing
object can only receive this message and any other communication must
be done through the control mechanism. In this state we can identify
two other sub-states: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Idle</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing</SPAN>. In the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing</SPAN>
state the object is actually performing the computations as a response
to a Do call while in the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Idle</SPAN> state the object has already
handed control to the Flow Control and is waiting to be called again.

<P>
Finally, the Stop operation will make a Running processing object
enter the Configured state. In this transition, memory can be deallocated
and execution variables reset.

<P>
It is interesting to note that this lifecycle is a variation/enhancement
of the lifecycle of a process in the Simula language. In [<A
 HREF="node207.html#DahlNygaardSimula">Dahl and Nygaard, 1966</A>]
it was stated that a process could be in one of four possible states:
(1) active, (2) suspended (3) passive and (4) terminated. On the other
hand, in section <A HREF="node54.html#sub:Ptolemy">2.2</A> we commented how Ptolemy, as many
other frameworks, distinguishes three execution phases: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">set-up</SPAN>,
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">run</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wrap-up</SPAN>. Note that in our case these three phases
are also explicit, with the Configure operation making most of the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">set-up</SPAN> operations, the Start operation finishing up the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">set-up</SPAN>
and making the transition to the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">run</SPAN> phase where the Do operation
is called, and the Stop operation in charge of the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">wrap-up</SPAN>.
