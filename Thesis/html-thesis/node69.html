FORMES
</H3>

<P>
FORMES [<A
 HREF="node207.html#RodetFORMES-CMJ">Rodet and Cointe, 1984</A>,<A
 HREF="node207.html#RodetFORMES">Rodet and Cointe, 1991</A>] was an interactive system
developed in VLisp first intended for Musical Composition and Synthesis.
But due to its architecture and flexibility it found applications
in areas such as speech synthesis or graphics animation. FORMES is
currently discontinued but its design has influenced the frameworks
that have been designed thereafter.

<P>
The main goals of FORMES were: generality; universality; independence
from a particular synthesis technique; compatibility, models compatible
in any context; simplicity of program text; ease of use; modularity;
and hierarchical construction.

<P>
In FORMES time-dependent objects are called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">processes</SPAN>, built
from sub-objects called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">offspring</SPAN>. A FORMES process groups
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">rules</SPAN> (procedure bodies), a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">monitor</SPAN> (a kind of scheduler),
and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">environment</SPAN> (local variables) and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">offspring</SPAN> (or
children). A process has the ability to ``sleep'', ``wakeup'',
``wait'' and ``synchronize'' when asked.

<P>
The role of each process is to ensure the calculation of a particular
musical characteristic. This calculation takes place during a precise
duration called span, from a begin time (btime) and an end time (etime).
These times, though do not need to be explicitly specified. Computation
is accomplished through rules in the process environment.

<P>
A process is defined by instantiating an original process called generator.
New processes can be defined from this original one by deriving from
it and adding features. A process may be built from subparts, themselves
built from subparts an so on. Therefore a process can have children
and a parent. The structure in which processes are organized can be
represented as a tree.

<P>
FORMES programs and commands can be prepared in files and then loaded
or typed on-line. A FORMES program is a structure of processes and
the execution involves the repetition of the following two steps:
(1) update the list of rules that make the calculation tree and (2)
execute or evaluate the rules.

<P>
Users communicate with processes by passing or sending messages whenever
they want to query a process on its nature, state, or capabilities
or they want it to do something. The user of FORMES can compose by
connecting already existing objects or by defining new processes.
All this is done in Lisp.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">monitor</SPAN> defines a temporal control structure. The monitor
of a process is the scheduler of its children. The monitor has three
tasks: (1) Determine the start time (btime) for each child and start
it; (2) Update the calculation tree when the state of the process
is modified; (3) If possible, determine the duration of the process
