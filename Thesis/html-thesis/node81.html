Music-N Languages 
</H2>

<P>
The Music-N paradigm was introduced by Max Mathews as a result of
his continuous iterations over his Music program. Out of all of them
it was probably Music-V the one that had most impact on the community
and most influenced the future evolution of computer music [<A
 HREF="node207.html#MathewsTechnology">Mathews, 1969</A>].
Music-V was written in Fortran and could therefore run on any computer
while previous attempts had been written directly in assembler and
could only run on specific hardware. Music-V and its derivatives,
thereafter known as Music-N languages, became popular in the 70's
but are still in use today. 

<P>
While designing Music-V, Max Mathews addressed two fundamental issues:
first, the great amount of data needed to specify a sound function;
and second, the need for a simple, powerful language to specify complex
sequences of sound. The way he tried to give solution to these problems
was to store functions to speed up computations,  to use <SPAN  CLASS="textit">unit
generator</SPAN> building blocks to provide flexibility, and to define the
concept of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">note</SPAN> for describing sound sequences [<A
 HREF="node207.html#PopeSuperCollider">Pope, 2004</A>].

<P>
The concept of unit generator is a central issue in Music-N languages.
A unit generator can be defined as the minimum functional entity in
a Music-N system. Traditional unit generators receive input control
signals and produce sound at their outputs and include functionalities
such as simple oscillators or envelope generators. Unit generators
can be combined into composite structures called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patches</SPAN>.

<P>
Another fundamental issue in Music-N languages is that a sound structure
is defined or programmed in two different parts: the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instrument</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">orchestra definition</SPAN> and the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">score</SPAN> or note list.
This model implicitly assumes that the composer can express everything
as a list of notes and that all sound processing or generation can
happen inside an instrument. In the synthesis process the composer
uses a group of sound objects (or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN>) known as the
orchestra. This orchestra is controlled from a score and is defined
using a programming language with specific functions. These functions
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">modules</SPAN> can be organized and combined in multiple ways in
order to define instruments. These instruments sounds can be controlled
from the score parameters or from other parameters in the same instrument.
A traditional Music-N orchestra file is very similar to a program
source code. The score initializes the system (with information usually
contained in the header) and then contains a list of time-stamped
notes that control the different instruments.

<P>
In this section we will present some music languages that comply to
the Music-N paradigm although most of them extend it in some particular
way.
