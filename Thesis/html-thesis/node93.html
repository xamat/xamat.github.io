Introduction
</H1>

<P>
At the time CLAM was started the Music Technology Group of the Pompeu
Fabra University had about thirty researchers involved in different
projects all of them related to the development of algorithms and
applications for Signal and Music Processing. Most of these applications
were implemented in C++. It was then clear that the amount and quality
of the lines of code coming from the different projects was becoming
hardly manageable. Although the code had been written using an OO-might-be
language like C++ and some classes existed here and there, basic design
principles had not been observed and the result was highly unstructured,
difficult to understand and hardly reusable. Flexibility and re-usability
had been sacrificed in the sake of what was though to be ``more
efficient''. This situation made it extremely difficult and time-consuming
to integrate newcomers or new projects into the group. Bearing those
ideas in mind, the CLAM project was started . Since then, an average
of five programmers-developers have been working on it. (See more
details on those practical issues in Annex <A HREF="node208.html#cha:CLAM-Additional-Information">A</A>).

<P>
For designing the framework we had to fight against an idea that still
has high acceptance in the DSP community: unstructured C-like code
assures high performance at run-time. One of the main goals of our
work has been to prove that a clean and structured design in general,
and OO techniques in particular, do not have to imply an overhead
in computational efficiency nor a limitation in flexibility for implementing
different models belonging to a particular domain.

<P>
The framework has been already used successfully for a number of internal
projects - some of them with high run-time performance requirements
- like high quality time-stretching, sax synthesizer and high-level
feature analysis, and it seems to have reached a somewhat mature stage.
The project saw its first public release in November 2002, in the
course of the AGNULA IST European project. AGNULA [<A
 HREF="node207.html#www-Agnula">www-Agnula, </A>]
(A GNU Linux Audio distribution) focused on offering a complete Linux
distribution, both in Debian and RedHat versions, promoting the use
of free software in the audio and music domain. 

<P>
The initial goal of the CLAM project was ``To offer a complete,
flexible and platform independent Sound Analysis/Synthesis C++ platform
to meet current and future needs of all MTG projects'' (quoted from
CLAM's first Working Draft). Those initial objectives have slightly
changed since then, mainly to accommodate to the fact that the library
is no longer seen as an internal tool for the MTG but as a library
that is licensed under the GPL [<A
 HREF="node207.html#FSF">Free Software Foundation, </A>] (GNU Public License) terms
and conditions.
