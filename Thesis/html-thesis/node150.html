Data Nodes 
</H4>

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Data Node</SPAN> is defined from the logical grouping of all arcs
(or FIFO queues) in the graph sharing a common source Port (see Figure
<A HREF="#fig:DSPOOM-DataNodes">4.9</A>). The interesting feature that leads us
to this logical grouping is that arcs with a common source may in
fact share the same FIFO queue, avoiding many unnecessary data copying
and moving at the only price of making flow control issues a bit more
complex. But then again, these issues should be automatic and transparent
to anyone not wishing to understand the details of this low-level
layer.

<P>

A DSPOOM Data Node acts as a connection slot where several Processing
objects can be connected. Out of all the connected Processing objects,
only one can be a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">producer</SPAN> while the rest will act as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">consumers</SPAN>.
In other words, all connected Ports except one must be Inports. As
already commented, connected Ports may have different and varying
sizes. The amount of data tokens that an Inport needs to process is
its only firing rule and these firing rules may be interpreted as
sliding windows or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">regions</SPAN>.

<P>
But a Data Node is more than a simple connection slot. First it must
be interpreted as a data container as it is here where the physical
FIFO queues are actually implemented. The implementation of these
FIFO queues in the Data Node admits different solutions but the most
immediate is based on a circular buffer with several reading and only
one writing region.

<P>
The Data Node is also in charge of keeping track of the different
regions connected to it. It is the Data Node responsibility to avoid
inconsistent situations and notify the flow control entity of any
exceptional state. Reading regions may be of any size and advance
at any rate. They may also overlap. Therefore, the only unwanted conditions
that the Data Node has to avoid are:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A reading region reads non-written data.
</LI>
<LI>The writing region advances a reading region and overwrites non-read
data
</LI>
</OL>
Although the Data Node can be understood as an implementation issue
that in most cases should be transparent to the user there may be
special cases in which the user would like to access a Data Node contents.
Some possible reasons for having to do so are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A Processing object has to be directly connected to an external data
source and this data has to be directly fed to the Data Node. This
is a common situation when developing plug-ins for APIs such as VST.
</LI>
<LI>The contents of a Data Node need to be visualized. In most cases it
will be sufficient to offer special Visualizer sink Processing objects
that are connected to the Data Node as just another regular Processing
object. But in other cases it may impossible to avoid accessing the
Data Node directly.
</LI>
<LI>The state of a Network may have to be passivated. The contents of
the Data Node are an important part of the Network state. They may
have to be passivated when passivating the Network.
</LI>
</UL>
We can therefore conclude as for what the Data Node issue concerns
that although it is an implementation detail located in a lower layer
than the rest of the Network facilities, it needs to offer a clear
and accessible interface as sometimes it will be interesting not to
completely hide it from the user.
