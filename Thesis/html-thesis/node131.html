CLAM classification</A>
</H2>

<P>
Out of the different categories presented in chapter <A HREF="node51.html#cha:Environments-for-Audio">2</A>,
CLAM fits better into the ``Audio Processing Frameworks'' one,
in the subcategory of ``General Purpose'' (see <A HREF="node66.html#sub:General-Purpose-Audio-Frmw">2.3.3</A>).
Nevertheless it shares some properties with environments in other
categories and has some particular features that make it different
from the other frameworks included in this subcategory.

<P>
Let us first highlight the similarities that CLAM shares with other
environments not in its subcategory. 

<P>
First, CLAM is a framework with a clear focus on audio and music but
its generic, open, and flexible model and design make it suitable
for processing any kind of signal data. Particularly, there are plans
to use the framework for image and video processing in the short term.
Therefore, it would be possible that, in the mid-term, CLAM would
fall into the first ``General Purpose Signal Processing and Multimedia
Frameworks'' category (see <A HREF="node53.html#sec:General-Purpose-Signal">2.2</A>).

<P>
Also CLAM is an object-oriented <SPAN  CLASS="textit">application framework</SPAN><A NAME="tex2html37"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5631"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A> as defined in section <A HREF="node23.html#sec:Frameworks">1.3</A>. Out of the different
audio and music environment reviewed, only MET++ (see <A HREF="node57.html#sub:MET++">2.2</A>)
and CSL (see <A HREF="node67.html#sub:CSL">2.3.3</A>) could be naturally defined as application
frameworks. 

<P>
But although we have just classified our framework as a ``General
Purpose Audio Processing Framework'', it includes many analysis tools
and features only comparable to the two frameworks included in the
``Analysis-Oriented Audio Processing Frameworks'' category (see
<A HREF="node59.html#sub:Analysis-Oriented-Audio-Frmw">2.3.1</A>), and particularly the most
mature one, Marsyas (see <A HREF="node60.html#sub:Marsyas">2.3.1</A>).

<P>
Furthermore, even though CLAM is probably more oriented toward audio
signal processing than toward musical symbolic data manipulation there
are clear examples and applications in which such a data is used extensively.
Nevertheless it is clear that CLAM does not, as most of the environments
discussed in section <A HREF="node71.html#sec:Music-Processing-Frameworks">2.4</A>, present
a particular model of Music. In this sense it is very similar conceptually
to Max (see <A HREF="node77.html#sub:Max">2.5</A>) although CLAM for being a framework it
allows to extend it and integrate different music models in it. In
chapter <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A> we introduce an Object-Oriented
Music model that has been implemented in the framework.

<P>
CLAM is not a graphical application, neither is this one of its main
features. For that reason it would make no sense to include it in
this category (see <A HREF="node75.html#sec:Audio-and-Music-Graphical-Apps">2.5</A>). Nevertheless
it includes a graphical ``network edition'' tool similar to that
present in all the environments in this category (see <A HREF="node124.html#sec:_CLAMApplications">3.2.3</A>).
This tool, though important, is seen as just a particular instantiation
of the framework and different graphical representations with distinct
features could be developed and integrated with not much effort.

<P>
Finally, CLAM is definitely not a Musical Language (see <A HREF="node80.html#sec:Music-Languages">2.6</A>)
but it includes one (explained in chapter <A HREF="node182.html#ch:_OO_Music_Model">6</A>)
as a particular instance of the general framework.

<P>
In figure <A HREF="node52.html#fig:Classification-of-environments">2.1</A> we presented a
graphical representation of how the different environments presented
in that chapter classified. In figure <A HREF="#fig:CLAM-classification-in">3.19</A>
we illustrate how CLAM would be positioned in respect to the other
environments. CLAM extends its scope from the general purpose signal
processing category and into the music processing realm, focusing
on all audio processing applications, from analysis to synthesis<A NAME="tex2html38"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot2616"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN></SUP></A>. We have also added to the figure CLAM's particular Visual Builder:
the Network Editor. We have done so in order to stress the fact that
this particular CLAM application is comparable in its scope to graphical
applications such as Kyma or Max.
