Networks</A>

<P>
A DSPOOM Network is a set of interconnected Processing objects that
collaborate for a common goal and can be modified on run-time. As
illustrated in figure <A HREF="#cap:DSPOOM-Network-Class">4.8</A>, it can be seen
as a set of Processing objects with connected input and output ports
and input and output controls.

Nevertheless, if we take a closer look the network entity is made
up of the following elements <A NAME="tex2html55"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot5649"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A>:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A list of processing objects
</LI>
<LI>A list of pairs of connected output port / input port.
</LI>
<LI>A list of reading and writing data types and window sizes (i.e. firing
rules) for all ports in the network
</LI>
<LI>A list of pairs of connected output control / input controls

</LI>
</UL>
A Network has a dynamic list of Processing objects that can be updated
at run-time. Therefore, the Network must offer facilities for inserting
or deleting new Processing objects. This operation could be done while
the network is executing. As a matter of fact the addition or suppression
of a Processing object from the network does not necessarily affect
the result of the process. The existence of a Processing object is
not relevant as long as it is not connected to the process graph.

<P>
In order to define this process graph, the network must keep track
of the list of connected pairs of input and output Ports. An output
Port may have any number of input Ports connected to it while an input
port can only be connected to a single output Port. 

<P>
All interconnected Ports should be strongly typed and expect the same
Processing Data type. But the amount of data tokens needed by every
Port is not predetermined, does not have to be the same for all ports
and does not even need to be fixed on run-time. The amount of data
tokens that a given Port needs to consume or produce in every execution
is determined by its associated <SPAN  CLASS="textit">region</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">window size</SPAN>.
In principle, and in a generic application, there is no forced relation
between the region sizes of connected ports. That is, an Outport many
have a very small region while the connected Inports have larger reading
regions. In this case the producing Processing object will have to
be triggered several times before the reading Processing objects can
proceed with an execution.

<P>
Apart from the main process graph defined by interconnected Ports,
a Network has a secondary graph defined by Controls and their connections.
As already commented in previous sections, while data flow is handled
in a synchronous manner, the control mechanism is event-driven. A
control event is transmitted from the output control to the connected
input controls as soon as it generates. The new control value overwrites
the previously existing one, even if it has still not been read.

<P>
But while the Control mechanism is very simple and does not need any
supervision, the data flow does need of some sort of external control.
The Network itself is in charge of managing writing and reading of
data. For doing so the Network must respond to a flow control policy
that has been pre-determined and fire the execution of the Processing
objects accordingly and by calling their Do operation. 

<P>
If, for instance, a static schedule is decided, window sizes for all
ports must remain fixed during execution. Then the network will determine
a static schedule complete cycle consisting of <!-- MATH
 $\mathrm{\mathcal{F\left(n\right)}}$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img48.png"
 ALT="$\mathrm{\mathcal{F\left(n\right)}}$"></SPAN>firings
for each nth Processing object. The execution of a network will stop
whenever a stop control is received at the network level (this control
may be generated, for instance, by the user or by the absence of data
at the network input).

<P>
Different dynamic flow control policies can be used depending on the
particular problem or system under study. Using a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pull</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lazy</SPAN>
policy the execution thread starts by the outermost Processing object
in the Network (the one whose output Port corresponds to the output
of the Network). If this Processing object checks that it does not
have enough input data it hands the control to the Processing object
whose output Port is connected to its inputs and so on. In the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">push</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">eager</SPAN> version, the process starts with the Processing object
that acts as the input to the chain and generating data until all
Processing objects connected to its output Port can process. Then
it hands control to them and they repeat the process.

<P>
A Network has compositional properties so it can be made of interconnected
Networks that in turn have other internal Networks, etc. Therefore,
when looking at a Network from the distance, it behaves also like
a Processing object and has input and output data as well as controls.

<P>
A Network is very much related to Processing Composites. The main
difference is that Processing Composites are decided at compile time.
Defining a new Processing Composite requires programming a new class
and combining existing Processing classes or Processing Composite
classes. A Processing Composite is seen at run-time as a regular Processing
object and therefore must have all flow control behavior coded into
the class. This behavior cannot be parameterized or changed and is
usually very much case-dependant. A Processing Composite is less flexible
than a corresponding Network but can be more efficient as it is designed
knowing the particular characteristics of the components and the overall
process being implemented. 

<P>
On the other hand, a Network is much more flexible, can be decided
at run-time without any programming. A Network is more flexible but
can sometimes result less efficient than a tuned processing composite.
In general terms, we will prefer a Network to a processing composite
and will only use Processing Composite after having used the corresponding
Network and having decided on optimization that would be necessary
in order to yield a more efficient result.

<P>
As a Network can be seen as a Processing object when looked from a
distance, it can also be classified into the same categories than
a Processing object. A Network is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">generating</SPAN> Network if it
has no inputs and a Network is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">sink</SPAN> Network if it has no
outputs.
