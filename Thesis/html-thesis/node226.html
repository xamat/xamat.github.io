On methodologies</A>
</H2>

<P>
The truth is that when the CLAM project started not much effort was
put into studying and applying specific framework development methodologies.
It turns out though that most decisions have been taken in the right
direction and the development process now seems to be in line with
what most authors recommend. In this section we will briefly describe
the methodologies used in the CLAM development.

<P>
As already commented, the development of the CLAM framework has followed
a bottom-up approach, starting from some sample applications that
have gradually evolve into being usage examples of the framework itself.
It is important to note that in section <A HREF="node27.html#sec:_FrameworkDevelopment">1.3.4</A>
we already reflected how this is an important guideline given by most
authors.

<P>
User feedback has always been an important component of the CLAM development
process. As a matter of fact the framework was used ever since it
began to be implemented and in many occasions, the line between the
framework developer and its user has been blurred (i.e. even the same
person can be acting as a part-time framework developer and a part-time
user).

<P>
The CLAM project started using quite traditional software engineering
methodologies but has evolved and come closer to more agile methodologies
like eXtreme Programming [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BeckXP">Beck, 1999</A>]. As even the proposers of
the methodology admit though, it is difficult to apply XP to a framework
development process. The main reason is that one of XP's fundamental
principles, which is to promote simplicity and avoid unnecessary generalizations
if not strictly necessary is hard to observe in a framework development
process. When developing a framework we are not only interested in
making an application work but also on generalizing or abstracting
as much of the common behavior as possible in order to build an infrastructure
for any further application. Furthermore, organizational issues, such
as the fact that most developers in an educational institution are
part-time collaborators, make it even harder. 

<P>
But we are definitely interested in many of XP's objectives such as
having a design that is as clean and simple as possible or the idea
of continuous integration and thorough testing Therefore many XP practices
have been considered and are used to some extent. These include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Small releases</SPAN>: although the public releases are still not
published as often as possible internal iterations last 15 days.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Testing</SPAN> through the use of the cppunit framework and Test-driven
development.
</LI>
<LI>Refactoring
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Collective ownership</SPAN> using the CVS and allowing any developer
to contribute in any part of the framework.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Code Standards</SPAN> adapted to our own needs.
</LI>
</UL>
Other practices such as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Simple Design</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Pair Programming</SPAN>
or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">On-site Costumer</SPAN> are used as much as possible in our particular
limitations.
