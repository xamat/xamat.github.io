Objects
</H2>

<P>
When we look up the word <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object</SPAN> in a dictionary we may find
definitions such as ``a thing that can be seen or touched''; ``a
person or thing to which action, thought, etc. is directed''; or
in more philosophical terms ``anything that can be perceived by
the mind''. 

<P>
In Software Engineering or Computer Science, though, the term has
acquired a new or more specialized meaning. A software object is still
an entity. The difference is that this object ``lives'' in the
computer or software world and not in the real world. But to be useful
in some way, the software object must have a more or less direct mapping
to a real object in the application domain. A software object may
represent a physical object in a particular domain but it may also
represent an abstract concept or idea. According to the Object Management
Group (OMG) of the ACM an object is ``an entity that has unique
identity, a set of operations that can be applied to it, and state
that stores the effect of the operations'' [<A
 HREF="node207.html#UML2.0">OMG, 2003</A>].

<P>
Therefore, an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object</SPAN> is made up of three basic components:
an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">identity</SPAN>, a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">state</SPAN>, and a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">behavior</SPAN> [<A
 HREF="node207.html#BoochOODesign">Booch, 1994b</A>].
The identity is the property that enables distinguishing two objects
with an identical state and behavior. The identity is unique and may
not be shared between different objects, even at different time and
does not change during the object lifetime. The object state represents
the different possible internal conditions that the object may experience
during its lifetime. Finally the object behavior is the way a particular
object will respond to received messages.

<P>
A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">class</SPAN> is an abstract group of objects that behave the same
way. Every existing object is the instance of a class. Not every class
though may have instances. A class that cannot be instantiated is
called an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">abstract class</SPAN>. A class is basically made up of a
unique name, a number of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">attributes</SPAN> and a set of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">operations</SPAN>
(the implementation of which is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">method</SPAN>). The attribute
values of a concrete object in a given moment define this object state.
Thus attributes in a class define the possible states in which an
instance of that class may be. On the other hand, the behavior of
an object depends on the class operations plus the particular state
of the object as operations may respond differently to input messages
depending on the current state. And again according to the OMG, a
class is ``a classifier that describes a set of objects that share
the same specifications of features, constraints, and semantics [<A
 HREF="node207.html#UML2.0">OMG, 2003</A>].

<P>
An object oriented system may be viewed exclusively as a set of objects
that are related and exchange messages, all collaborating to accomplish
a common goal that is related to the functional requirements of the
system (we will thoroughly define what a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">system</SPAN> is in section
<A HREF="node17.html#sec:_Systems">1.2.1</A>). An OO message is made of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">receiver</SPAN>,
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">selector</SPAN> and an optional <SPAN  CLASS="textit">list of arguments</SPAN>. The receiver
is the object that will receive the message. The selector informs
the receiving object of which of all the possible messages it can
interpret is being sent. And finally the the optional list of arguments
holds the values with which the receiver will interpret the message.

<P>
The way that objects are related in run-time is defined by the way
the classes are associated in the logical view of the system. There
are basically four kinds of class relationships: association, aggregation/composition,
dependency and inheritance. Each relationship is established between
two classes and, apart of the ``kind'' of relationship, we should
describe its navigability (whether objects in both ends of the relation
are able to see each other or this navigation is restricted in only
one direction) , and cardinality (how many instances of each class
can participate in the relationship). Other less important attributes
in the relationship such as its name, roles of the participants or
visibility may also be included.

<P>
An association is the most basic - and weakest - form of relationship.
It basically represents that instances of one class know of the whole
or part of instances of the other class. That means that instances
of one end can access operations or attributes in the other end. All
other relations, except for inheritance, can be viewed as particular
cases of an association.

<P>
A stronger form of association is known as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">aggregation.</SPAN> An
aggregation represents a relationship between some ``parts'' and
a ``whole''. In an aggregation, instances in one end of the relationship
``contain'' or are ``made up'' objects of the other end. A
particular case of aggregation is a composition. In a composition
the life of the parts is connected to the life of its whole. When
a part is instantiated, it must be already created as belonging to
a whole and when the whole is destroyed, its parts are also destroyed.

<P>
Probably the most powerful technique associated to object oriented
methods is the inheritance relationship. If a given class A derives
from class B, class A is said to be a subclass of B while B is said
to be a superclass or a base class for A. A derived class inherits
all the behavior implemented in its base class but is also allowed
to add or override behavior. A rule of thumb for identifying if a
given class can be modeled as a subclass of another one is the 'is
a rule': if the sentence ``A is a B'' makes sense, then probably
A is a subclass of B (e.g. ``A dog is a mammal'').
