Network infrastructure 
</H3>

<P>
A CLAM Network is a dynamic composition of Processing objects. In
a Network Processing objects can be added, deleted, connected and
reconfigured on run-time. All this functionality is implemented in
the Network class and associated classes, which will be explained
in the following paragraphs.

<P>
Apart from an identifying name, a Network has two important attributes
and an interface for interacting with them. These attributes are:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Map</SPAN> of Processing objects. This is a standard stl vector
than contains pointers to instantiated Processing objects and uses
a unique name for each Processing object as the key.
</LI>
<LI>An associated <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Flow Control</SPAN>. A Network can follow different
execution and control policies. This policies are encapsulated in
the <TT>FlowControl</TT> class that will be later explained.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
A Processing object is added to the Network by indicating its class
name. The Network then uses a Processing Factory in order to instantiate
a new object belonging to that class and assigning it a unique identifier.
The Processing Factory follows the Factory Method design pattern (see
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#GOF">Gamma et&nbsp;al., 1995</A>]) and in particular the idiom described as Object Factory
in [<A
 HREF="node207.html#Alexandrescu">Alexandrescu, 2001</A>].

<P>
Different operations are also offered to remove, check existence or
configure existing Processing objects. An existing Processing object
can be accessed by its unique name or using an iterator interface
for traversing the whole collection.

<P>
All Ports and Controls in the contained Processing are also identified
by a name string. Their unique identifier is formed by the concatenation
of the Processing unique identifier and the Control or Port Name.
Ports and Controls can be accessed by this unique identifier. Furthermore
all the InPorts connected to a given <TT>Outport</TT> or all the <TT>InControls</TT>
connected to a given <TT>OutControl</TT> can be accessed. The <TT>Network</TT>
interface offers methods for connecting and disconnecting Ports and
Controls by using these unique identifiers. It also offers a convenience
operation for disconnecting all Ports at once.

<P>
The Network also offers an interface similar to a regular Processing
object. The <TT>Start</TT> and <TT>Stop</TT> operations iterate through
all the Processing objects calling their <TT>Start</TT> or <TT>Stop</TT>
operations. The <TT>DoProcessings</TT> operation also iterates through
all the Processing objects calling their <TT>Do</TT> operation. This
iteration, though, is performed in different ways, depending on the
configured Flow Control policy.

<P>
A Network is a CLAM <TT>Component</TT> and can therefore implement
storage facilities through the <TT>StoreOn</TT> and <TT>LoadFrom</TT>
operations (see ``XML Support'' in section <A HREF="node119.html#sec:_CLAMTools">3.2.2</A>).
A Network is passivated into XML as a collection of Processing objects
and their connections. See the following example:
<BR>
<P>
<BR>
<IMG
 WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="336" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img25.png"
 ALT="\begin{spacing}{0.8}
\texttt{\footnotesize &lt;network id=\char\lq \uml {}FooNetwork\c...
...
}
\par
\texttt{\footnotesize &lt;/network&gt;}&nbsp;\\
{\footnotesize\par
}
\end{spacing}">
<BR>

<P>
Finally, and as already mentioned, the execution policy in a Network
is encapsulated inside the <TT>FlowControl</TT> class. A Flow Control
object must be attached to a Network before its execution. This Flow
Control object is notified whenever a new Processing object is added
or removed from the Network therefore changing its topology. It is
also notified when a Processing object is configured, in which case
the Flow Control is in charge of reconfiguring its Ports if necessary.

<P>
The <TT>FlowControl</TT> class is an abstract class with a single
abstract method, the <TT>DoProcessings</TT>. This method has to be
implemented in the derived classes that will implement a particular
scheduling policy. At this moment two different policies have been
implemented: a lazy-evaluation or pull policy and an eager or push
execution policy.
