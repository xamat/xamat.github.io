Composing with DSPOOM Objects: Networks and Processing Composites
</H2>

<P>
The DSPOOM metamodel offers different mechanisms for composing with
Processing objects. In this section we will show their features and
intent. Composition in DSPOOM is not an absolute need as any model
can be fully specified by a number of independent though coordinated
Processing objects. Nevertheless, building self-contained sub-models
(thus abstract subsystems) offers a number of advantages, namely:

<P>

<OL>
<LI><SPAN ID="txt2975">Complexity and detail hiding</SPAN>. Submodels can act as intermediate
layers that hide complexity from the user. This way we can choose
what details will be promoted from one level to another and what formal
view we want to offer the user of each layer.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN ID="txt2976">Flow control automation</SPAN>. By building coherent and homogeneous
compositions we are able to apply standardized approaches to automatic
flow control in which an ``intelligent'' entity is able to manage
data flow and process execution.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN ID="txt2978">Efficiency and optimization</SPAN>. A composition can be a specialized
grouping of Processing objects with a specific purpose and goal. By
using information about the context in which each individual and possibly
generic Processing object is used, we can manage to optimize the overall
execution. 
</LI>
</OL>
The two mechanisms for composing with Processing objects in a DSPOOM
model are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Networks</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Processing Composites</SPAN>. Networks
are dynamic compositions that can be modified at run time in any way
by adding new Processing objects or modifying connections. Processing
Composites are static compositions that are built on compile time
and cannot be modified thereafter. These DSPOOM constructs were already
graphically illustrated in figure <A HREF="node136.html#fig:Basic-elements-in">4.1</A>.

<P>
Note that both mechanisms address the first of the three benefits
previously enumerated. But while Networks promote the ability to use
automatic flow control (benefit number 2), Processing Composites strive
for efficiency (benefit number 3). As R. Dannenberg points out in
[<A
 HREF="node207.html#DannenbergAuraICMC04">Dannenberg, 2004</A>] it may seem at first sight that static
composition is not useful in the general case as, although it can
be more efficient, it is far less flexible. But experience indicates
that static composition is preferred in many occasions due to a number
of different advantages: it avoids dynamic patching and therefore
becomes more efficient, it enables inlining and other performance
tricks, it allows better debugging and finally and most important,
users can reason better about their code when it is static.

<P>
In general the dynamic composition offered by Networks follows the
Dataflow Architecture pattern while the static composition in Processing
Composites follows the Adaptive Pipeline pattern (see <A HREF="node45.html#sub:Patterns-of-Graphical">1.5.3</A>).
Networks are also somehow related to Max's, CSL's and OSW's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patches</SPAN>
( see <A HREF="node77.html#sub:Max">2.5</A>, <A HREF="node67.html#sub:CSL">2.3.3</A>, and <A HREF="node64.html#sub:Open-Sound-World">2.3.2</A>)
while Processing Composites are similar to Aura's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">instruments</SPAN>
(see <A HREF="node65.html#sub:W_Aura">2.3.2</A>).
