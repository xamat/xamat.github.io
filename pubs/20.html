<div class="abstract">
The task of building a description language for audio synthesis
 and processing consists of balancing a variety of conflicting
 demands and constraints such as easy learning curve, usability, flexibility, extensibility, and run-time performance. There
 are many alternatives as to what a modern language for describing signal processing patches should look like. This pa-
 per describes the object-oriented models and design patterns
 used in version 4 of the CREATE Signal Library (CSL), a
 full rewrite that included an effort to use concepts from the
 ”4MS” metamodel for multimedia systems, and to integrate
 a set of design patterns for signal processing. We refer the
 reader to other publications for an introduction to CSL, and
 will concentrate on design and implementation choices in CSL4
 that simplify the kernel classes, improve their performance,
 and ease their extension while using best-practice software
 engineering techniques.
