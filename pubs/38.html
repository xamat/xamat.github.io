           Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms, used to build web-
based recommender systems, are often evaluated in terms of
how accurately they predict user ratings. However, current
evaluation techniques disregard the fact that users continue
to rate items over time: the temporal characteristics of the
systemâ€™s top-N recommendations are not investigated. In
particular, there is no means of measuring the extent that
the same items are being recommended to users over and
over again. In this work, we show that temporal diversity
is an important facet of recommender systems, by showing
how CF data changes over time and performing a user sur-
vey. We then evaluate three CF algorithms from the point of
view of the diversity in the sequence of recommendation lists
they produce over time. We examine how a number of char-
acteristics of user rating patterns (including profile size and
time between rating) affect diversity. We then propose and
evaluate set methods that maximise temporal recommenda-
tion diversity without extensively penalising accuracy.
