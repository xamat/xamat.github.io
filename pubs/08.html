     Content description has become a topic of interest for
many researchers in the audiovisual field [1][2]. While manual
annotation has been used for many years in different
applications, the focus now is on finding automatic content-
extraction and content-navigation tools. An increasing number
of projects, in some of which we are actively involved, focus
on the extraction of meaningful features from an audio signal.
Meanwhile, standards like MPEG7 [3] are trying to find a
convenient way of describing audiovisual content.
Nevertheless, content description is usually thought of as an
additional information stream attached to the ‘actual content’
and the only envisioned scenario is that of a search and
retrieval framework.
<br>
     However, in this article it will be argued that if there is a
suitable content description, the actual content itself may no
longer be needed and we can concentrate on transmitting only
its description. Thus, the receiver should be able to interpret
the information that, in the form of metadata, is available at its
inputs, and synthesize new content relying only on this
description. It is possibly in the music field where this last step
has been further developed, and that fact allows us to think of
such a transmission scheme being available on the near future.
