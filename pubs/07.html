<div class="abstract">
Since the MIDI 1.0 specification [1], well over 15 years ago, many have been the attempts to give
a solution to all the limitations that soon became clear. None of these have had a happy ending,
mainly due to commercial interests and as a result, when trying to find an appropriate synthesis
control user interface, we had not many choices but the use of MIDI. Thatâ€™s the reason why the
idea of defining a new user interface aroused. In this article, the main components of this interface
will be discussed, paying special attention to the advantages and new features it reports to the end-
user.
