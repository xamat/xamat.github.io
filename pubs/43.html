          Context has been recognized as an important factor to consider in
personalized Recommender Systems. However, most model-based
Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not
provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into
the model. In this work, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method
based on \emph{Tensor Factorization},
a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and
generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as
a User-Item-Context $N$-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D
User-Item matrix. In the proposed model, called \emph{Multiverse
Recommendation}, different types of context are considered as
additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a
tensor. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of
the data which can be used to provide context-aware
recommendations.
<br>
<br>
We provide an algorithm to address the
$N$-dimensional factorization, and show that the \emph{Multiverse
Recommendation} improves upon non-contextual Matrix Factorization up to $30\%$
in terms of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We also compare to two state-of-the-art
context-aware methods and show that Tensor Factorization consistently outperforms them
both in semi-synthetic and real-world data -- improvements range from $2.5\%$ to more than
$12\%$ depending on the data. Noticeably, our approach outperforms other methods by
a wider margin whenever more contextual information is available.
