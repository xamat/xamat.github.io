 This paper discusses about benefits derived from providing XML support to the component based
framework for audio systems that we are developing. XML is used as data format for persistency,
visualization and inter-application interface. Direct XML support is a very useful feature for an
audio framework because of the popularity of the XML format as data interchange format, and
the introduction of MPEG7 standard, an XML based description format for multimedia content.
Formatting task has been distributed along the system objects in a compositional way, making easy
to format a single object from its parts. The system minimizes the overhead added to a class and
the programmer effort to support XML I/O. A default XML implementation has been provided
for most of the future data structures, giving the chance to customize it. The system has been
designed to be reused with other formats with a minimal impact on the system.
