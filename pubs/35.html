<div class="abstract">
Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms, which generate
recommendations for web users by predicting
user-item ratings, are often evaluated according
to their predictions; in this context the problem of
generating recommendations can be formulated as
one of fitting a community of users to the best set
of predictors. However, the data used to perform
CF is sparse, and accuracy is limited by both the
quantity and quality of information available. Mining
the web has the potential to address these issues:
the quality and quantity of ratings can be incremented
by collecting external sources of rating
information. In this work we introduce a method
to perform CF with external data sources; furthermore,
we show that a community of users can be
partitioned according to what external source acts
as a better predictor of each user's preferences. In
particular, we find that a single kNN predictor can
achieve remarkably high prediction accuracy if the
data sources are selected optimally: designing a
recommender system can thus be approached with
the focus on data quality rather than algorithmic
method.</div>
