Content processing is a vast and growing field that integrates
different approaches borrowed from the signal processing,
information retrieval and machine learning disciplines. In
this article we deal with a particular type of content processing: the so-called content-based transformations. We will
not focus on any particular application but rather try to give
an overview of different techniques and conceptual implications. We first describe the transformation process itself,
including the main model schemes that are commonly used,
which lead to the establishment of the formal basis for a
definition of content-based transformations. Then we take a
quick look at a general spectral based analysis/synthesis
approach to process audio signals and how to extract features
that can be used in the content-based transformation context.
Using this analysis/synthesis approach we give some examples on how content-based transformations can be applied to
modify the basic perceptual axis of a sound and how we can
even combine different basic effects in order to perform more
meaningful transformations. We finish by going a step further
in the abstraction ladder and present transformations that are
related to musical (and thus symbolic) properties rather than
to those of the sound or the signal itself.
