           In this chapter, we give an overview of the main Data Mining techniques
that are applied in the context of Recommender Systems. We first describe common
preprocessing methods such as sampling or dimensionality reduction. Next, we re-
view a the most important classification techniques, including Bayesian Networks
and Support Vector Machines. We describe the so popular k-means clustering algo-
rithm and discuss several alternatives. We also present association rules and present
algorithms for an efficient training process. In addition to introducing these tech-
niques, we survey their uses in Recommender Systems and present cases where
they have been successfully applied.
