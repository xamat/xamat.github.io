<div class="abstract">
CLAM is a C++ framework that offers a complete development and research platform for the audio and music domain. Apart from offering an abstract model for audio
systems, it also includes a repository of processing algorithms and data types as well as a number of tools such as audio or MIDI input/output. All these features can be exploited to build cross-platform applications or to build rapid prototypes to test signal processing algorithms. In this article we will review the main features included in the framework. We will also present some of the applications that have been developed and can be used by themselves. We will finally introduce the newest tools that
have been added in order to use the framework as a rapid prototyping tool.
