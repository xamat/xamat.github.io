Nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering provides a successful
means of generating recommendations for web users. How-
ever, this approach suffers from several shortcomings, in-
cluding data sparsity and noise, the cold-start problem, and
scalability. In this work, we present a novel method for rec-
ommending items to users based on expert opinions. Our
method is a variation of traditional collaborative filtering:
rather than applying a nearest neighbor algorithm to the
user-rating data, predictions are computed using a set of ex-
pert neighbors from an independent dataset, whose opinions
are weighted according to their similarity to the user. This
method promises to address some of the weaknesses in tradi-
tional collaborative filtering, while maintaining comparable
accuracy. We validate our approach by predicting a subset
of the Netflix data set. We use ratings crawled from a web
portal of expert reviews, measuring results both in terms of
prediction accuracy and recommendation list precision. Fi-
nally, we explore the ability of our method to generate useful
recommendations, by reporting the results of a user-study
where users prefer the recommendations generated by our
approach.
