The UCSB Allosphere is a 3-story-high spherical instrument in which
virtual environments and performances can be experienced in full immersion. The
space is now being equipped with high-resolution active stereo projectors, a 3D
sound system with several hundred speakers, and with tracking and interaction
mechanisms.
The Allosphere is at the same time multimodal, multimedia, multi-user,
immersive, and interactive. This novel and unique instrument will be used for
research into scientiﬁc visualization/auralization and data exploration, and as a
research environment for behavioral and cognitive scientists. It will also serve as
a research and performance space for artists exploring new forms of art. In par-
ticular, the Allosphere has been carefully designed to allow for immersive music
and aural applications.
In this paper, we give an overview of the instrument, focusing on the audio
subsystem. We give the rationale behind some of the design decisions and ex-
plain the different techniques employed in making the Allosphere a truly general-
purpose immersive audiovisual lab and stage. Finally, we present ﬁrst results
and our experiences in developing and using the Allosphere in several prototype
projects.
