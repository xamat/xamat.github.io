<div class="abstract">
          We present an approach to software framework development
that includes the generation of domain-specific languages
(DSL) and pattern languages as goals for the process. Our
model is made of three workflows – framework, metamodel,
and patterns – and three phases – inception, construction, and
formalization. The main conclusion is that when developing a
framework we can produce with minimal overhead – almost
as a side-effect – a metamodel with an associated DSL,
and a pattern language. Both outputs will not only help
the framework evolve in the right direction but will also be
valuable in themselves.
   In order to illustrate these ideas, we present a case-study in
the multimedia domain. For several years we have been developing a multimedia framework. The process has produced
a full-fledged domain-specific metamodel for the multimedia
domain, with an associated DSL, and a pattern language.
