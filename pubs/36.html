A common approach to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items in order to
collect feedback about their preferences. However, users have been shown to be
inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects
the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy
by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step.
In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the
response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise.
Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise
existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously
rated items again. This denoising step yields accuracy improvements of up to 14% when
processing all items in the original dataset.
However, this level of re-rating is unpractical in most situations. Therefore, we
study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only part of the original ratings.
In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies (data and user-dependent denoising)
that yield over 8% of accuracy gains with respect to the original RMSE while denoising only 20% of the original dataset.
Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We measure an accuracy
gain per rating -- in terms of RMSE improvement -- that is $4$ times larger when adding re-ratings than when
adding new ratings. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data
and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items.
