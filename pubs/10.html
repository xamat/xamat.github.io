<div class="abstract">
As audio and music applications tend to a higher level of abstraction and to fill in the gap between the signal processing
world and the end-user we are more and more interested on processing content and not (only) signal. This change in
point of view leads to the redefinition of several “classical” concepts, and a new conceptual framework needs to be set
to give support to these new trends. In [2], a model for the transmission of audio content was introduced. The model is
now extended to include the idea of Sound Objects. With these thoughts in mind, examples of design decisions that
have led to the implementation of the CLAM framework are also given.
