For half a century, television has been a dominant and per-
vasive mass media, driving many technological advances.
Despite its widespread usage and importance to emerging
applications, the ingrained TV viewing habits are not com-
pletely understood. This was primarily due to the difficulty
of instrumenting monitoring devices at individual homes at
a large scale. The recent boom of Internet TV (IPTV) has
enabled us to monitor the user behavior and network usage
of an entire network. Such analysis can provide a clearer
picture of how people watch TV and how the underlying
networks and systems can better adapt to future challenges.
In this paper, we present the first analysis of IPTV work-
loads based on network traces from one of the world’s largest
IPTV systems. Our dataset captures the channel change ac-
tivities of 250,000 households over a six month period. We
characterize the properties of viewing sessions, channel pop-
ularity dynamics, geographical locality, and channel switch-
ing behaviors. We discuss implications of our findings on
networks and systems, including the support needed for fast
channel changes. Our data analysis of an operational IPTV
system has important implications on not only existing and
future IPTV systems, but also the design of the open In-
ternet TV distribution systems such as Joost and BBC’s
iPlayer that distribute television on the wider Internet.
