           This paper presents a field study of a framework for personalized mobile recommendations in the tourism domain,
of sight-seeing Points of Interest (POI). We evaluate the
effectiveness, satisfaction and divergence from popularity
of a knowledge-based personalization strategy comparing it
to recommending most popular sites. We found that participants visited more of the recommended POIs for lists
with popular but non-personalized recommendations. In
contrast, the personalized recommendations led participants
to visit more POIs overall and visit places “off the beaten
track”. The level of satisfaction between the two conditions
was comparable and high, suggesting that our participants
were just as happy with the rarer, “off the beaten track”
recommendations and their overall experience. We conclude
that personalized recommendations set tourists into a discovery mode with an increased chance for serendipitous findings, in particular for returning tourists.
