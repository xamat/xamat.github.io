In this paper, we introduce 4MPS, a Metamodel for
Multimedia Processing Systems. The goal of 4MPS is to offer a
generic system metamodel that can be instantiated to describe any
multimedia processing design. The metamodel combines the advantages
of the object-oriented paradigm and metamodeling techniques
with system engineering principles and graphical models of
computation.
4MPS is based on the classification of multimedia processing objects
into two main categories: Processing objects that operate on
data and controls, and Data objects that passively hold media content.
Processing objects encapsulate a method or algorithm. They
also include support for synchronous data processing and asynchronous
event-driven Controls as well as a configuration mechanism
and an explicit life cycle state model. Data input to and output
from Processing objects is done through Ports. Data objects offer
a homogeneous interface to media data, and support for metaobject-
like facilities such as reflection and serialization.
The metamodel can be expressed in the language of graphical
models of computation such as the Dataflow Networks and presents
a comprehensive conceptual framework for media signal processing
applications. 4MPS has its practical validation in several
existing environments, including the authorâ€™s CLAM framework.
