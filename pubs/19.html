<div class="abstract">
The Sound and Music Computing field has a rich history of frameworks that to offer a
more or less complete set of tools for application builders [7, 13, 5, 6, 19]. Most of these
frameworks end up offering a variation of Data-flow Networks [14].
There have been previous efforts in building pattern languages for the data-flow paradigm,
most noticeably the one by Manolescu [15]. The present article takes our experience building
generic audio frameworks and models [1, 27] and maps them to traditional Graphical Models
of Computation (mostly Dataflows but also Petri Nets and Process Networks, [14, 17, 18])
in order to offer an initial pattern catalog —aiming to grow into a pattern language— for
the audio domain1 .
All the patterns presented in this catalog fit within the generic architectural pattern defined
by Manolescu as the Data Flow Architecture pattern.
