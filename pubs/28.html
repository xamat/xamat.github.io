The UCSB Allosphere is a 3-story-high spherical instrument
in which virtual environments and performances can
be experienced in full immersion. It is made of a perforated
aluminum sphere, ten meters in diameter, suspended
inside an anechoic cube. The space is now being equipped
with high-resolution active stereo projectors, a 3D sound
system with several hundred speakers, and with tracking
and interaction mechanisms.
The Allosphere allows for the exploration of large-scale
data sets in an environment that is at the same time multimodal,
multimedia, multi-user, immersive, and interactive.
This novel and unique instrument will be used for
research into scientific visualization/auralization and data
exploration, and as a research environment for behavioral
and cognitive scientists. It will also serve as a research and
performance space for artists exploring new forms of art.
In particular, the Allosphere has been carefully designed
to allow for immersive music applications.
In this paper, we give an overview of the instrument, focusing
on the audio subsystem. We present first results
and our experiences in developing and using the Allosphere
in several prototype projects.
