We present the design of the Allosphere and initial experiences
from its ongoing implementation. The UCSB Allosphere is a novel
large-scale instrument for immersive visualization and simulation,
which in its full realization will be one of the worldâ€™s largest immersive
environments. The three-story high cubical space comprises an
anechoic chamber with a spherical display screen, ten meters in diameter,
surrounding from one to thirty users standing on a bridge
structure. The Allosphere is differentiated from conventional virtual
reality environments by its size and focus on collaborative experiences,
its seamless surround-view capabilities and its focus on
multiple sensory modalities and interaction. The Allosphere is being
equipped with high-resolution active stereo projectors, a complete
3D sound system with hundreds of speakers, and interaction
technology. In this paper we will give an overview of the purpose of
the instrument as well as the systems that are being put into place in
order to equip it. We also review the first results and experiences in
developing and using the Allosphere in several prototype projects.
